5,Once the operating procedure is learned the program is easy to operate and errors can be corrected quickly . The opening front page shows the general aspects of all the company functions at a glance and will allow expansion of each section with a click of a button.

5,I love this software I used sage before which took ages and as a small business I never used it's full potential. This is easy and has some great features for projects and invoicing I would recommend. The bank link is great and the whole system is simple and easy to use.

2,I have really liked this program.

2,"For the most part, the software is pretty easy to use, although it could be a lot more intelligent when it sees bills from the same contractor and should be able to guess what the purchase is for, and the vat rate, or it should allow templates to be set up for different contractors. The main bug-bear for me is as a property developer, I find the workarounds for CIS dreadfully cumbersome. In its defence, FreeAgent support staff are very good which is why I give it 2 stars not 1. Bear in mind once you have picked your software, it is such a pain to switch to another provider (enter all your transactions in again) that you need to get it right first time.",2020-01-27T21:55:06Z,Dr. R.,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e2f5c39e5a4c71a7c89558d

3,"Once up and running Free Agent handles my accounts (and MTD Vat returns) just fine .. it does the VAT return far better than I ever did manually. It is not really saving me any work as I still run my old spreadsheet based accounts in parallel. It is worrying however, that FreeAgent gets total access to your bank and credit card accounts and in some cases requires a complete copy of your login security information .. this is the fault of the banks more than Free Agent, I guess. Setting up Free Agent really needs the help of an accountant; there are are all kinds of start values that should be entered to set the baseline for accounting. EG I was owed a VAT refund from HMRC for the months prior to starting to use Free Agent but never found a way to reclaim it using Free Agent and gave up. Free support is available by bot and when that fails by email with an adviser, but I failed to understand much of the advice (which was in accountancy speak journal entries and Contra accounts). My accountant says he is bombarded with so many different MTD packages that he can't possibly use the data from Free Agent (and all the others), so I still have to send end of year accounts as a spreadsheet. I guess a combination of Free Agent and a Free Agent friendly accountant might be pretty good .. I'm looking into it... but then I'd worry that Free Agent will suddenly become very expensive (Currently it is free to RBS business customers - but no guarantee that will last) or go belly up and disappear.",2020-01-24T10:36:15Z,Mr Nick Arran,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/543e8b53000064000190554e

5,"I really like FreeAgent. well, obviously I don't like the fact I have to pay for it and I could be more proactive in recruiting other users and therefore cutting my costs... but anyway, as a self employed person it's perfect. I pretty much do everything on my mobile - create and send invoices, reconciliation of bank, and all that other accounting jargon I don't really understand! it's really easy to use. I guess I would like some of the reports to be better [they know this, I've told them!] but overall I am super duper happy. oh, also the support is great, if you contact them they really do try to help in a timely manner [as the corporate folk say]. love it!",2020-01-22T17:17:49Z,Lynne,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e2883bdddcefa76025c9b1c
2,I really liked free agent at first but now I am getting increasingly frustrated with the software continuously calculating my VAT return incorrectly. They have calculated a return based on a previous return that wasn't submitted via free agent and have assumed that I was on the Standard scheme when I have been on the flat rate scheme for a number of years. Instead of correcting they have advised to speak to my accountant or open a new account. This is not an effective or efficient solution. I suggest that if you are thinking of buying this product that you properly test it within the month trial as I am now having regrets.,2020-01-22T16:32:28Z,LDee,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/568948540000ff0001f8ecde

In my experience the support when I have needed advice on using the software has always been timely, helpful and couched in a language that non-accountants can understand. The latter is particularly valuable as some accounting packages I have used in the past have seemed to enjoy putting a barrier of understanding between non professionals and themselves, presumably to maintain the mystique of accountancy!

5,"FreeAgent is a very easy to use accounting system that meets all the basic functionality that you need. The help service is fantastic if you do have queries or need a little more explanation or guidance. The help library is very good but the online help is fantastic. Really helpful answers or if the system cannot do something you are looking for (say creating an invoice with lines from the account headings such as Hotels, Car Parking etc consolidated) then if they think its a good idea then they will put it to the development team or tell you another way if possible or that it can't be done. Straight forward and honest! It's very easy for employees to record expenses onto the system and post receipts using the mobile app. The system cannot produce your Accounts for filing at companies house so you need other software - likewise for Corporation Tax (CT) submissions. However, I like the fact that the system does produce your basic CT computation and does the automatic accounting entries for this. It would be great if Accounts and CT filing could be integrated just like RTI for payroll or VAT filing is integrated currently. Overall for small and medium sized business this is a great package.",2020-01-03T11:20:38Z,Rod,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5e0f2385b14ccfc7d1fa232b

5,I work as a freelancer in the events industry and it's pretty perfect. The invoices look professional and I love that you can style them with CSS. Then how it syncs with multiple bank accounts is perfect as you can assign expenses to projects and add your receipts. Plus of course it helps out massively with the tax return. I'm not going back to the spreadsheet days as it often meant mistakes were made copying information and keeping track of expenses just isn't fun. There are only a few minor workflow issues it would be great if they fixed.,2019-12-20T14:18:26Z,Gareth,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5dfcd8316af502491728db07

4,"Whilst the portal is extremely easy to use and bearing in mind that I use various accounting portals (and by the way I really like Freeagent), it seems to me that some extra features need to be added. For instance: 1. Non sterling bank accounts should allow explanations entered as money paid to user. 2. There must be an option to change the accounting reference. 3. The VAT deregistration process could be made a bit clearer now that MTD for VAT is in force. We have a client who's required to file a final return but the submission keeps failing. Freeagent's been contacted but no progress. We'll keep trying until this works of course. 4. Accounting reports - perhaps more needed when it comes to management accounts, esp with cashflow forecasts, budgeting etc. 5. Bank feed issue - with open banking I think that there should have been slightly more done, for example, an automatic email or reminder sent out to the primary account holder. Or in the event that the feeds do not work or stall, the primary account holder gets notification immediately. There are some more things that I'd like to add but I believe this is best dealt with on a case by case basis. To reiterate, Freeagent is amazing and really simple and I like it a lot but I, personally, feel a bit more is needed.",2019-12-17T12:36:47Z,Keshav,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5df8cbde7293b151f2f62acd
5,Freeagent is a fabulous service - the software makes our lives running a small business SO much easier and our accountant and tax advisors love it.

5,"FreeAgent is a game-changer in terms of managing your business finances. Feature-wise, it is very similar to other well-known accounting packages and offers all of the technical wizardry that is expected these days i.e. Open Banking Bank Feeds, Integrations with Payment Systems etc The reason it is so good is down to two aspects: 1) The simplicity of the system and 2) the support that FreeAgent provides through its customer service function. By spending an hour or so each week on the system, you can soon gain complete control over your business finances and when it comes to preparing accounts, FreeAgent has an Accountant Directory of Accountants who support the software and can take the figures and produce your Accounts and Tax Returns.",2019-12-10T10:18:48Z,Andy,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5def71071ef7dc75b3dc7514

1,Absolutely awful! Freeagent only now downloads the bank account transactions a few times per week which makes it difficult to manage your accounts. I have moved one of my businesses to another system and have one left to move. I have been in conversation and contact with the team at Freeagent and the issue is that the system now does not allow the bank feed to be used more that a few times per week at specific timings. I have given my feedback to the team that the system is not fit for purpose.,2019-12-09T16:25:08Z,Scott Lister ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5dee7564ebb74616c0063251

3,"RE-EDITING - 3-stars is given not because of their customer service which is good - polite and patient team and just okay application but because if you really intend to run your own accounting as a small business or limited company, like me, you can pull your hair and lose lots of hours/time and not get a straight answer from software - as navigation and documentation is poorly designed in my view but not terrible but just not helpful in my view and does not help to abide by HMRC rules and order of things need to be done. They really shy away from any even standard accounting advice. Also, be careful, sometimes different areas don't sync/refresh so see all fields carefully before submitting returns. It seems like at first at least, till you learn, you may need accounting hire. I used one of their recommended accountant on the phone as I had a very simple one thing left (after pulling my hair and wasting away time for a month) and accountant was really nice. It is just that consider if cost of freeagent to you if any, and to save sanity, time, and not to get fined by the cruel HMRC, you may benefit from their recommended accountant.

5,It was an automated response but they guessed what it was I wanted to do and I was done pretty easily. It's a bit of a ballache classifying a lot of transactions and some inline help on what each option means would be useful but that's what we're paying accounts for right? I mean since this s/w arrived they do pretty much do stuff all anyway.,2019-11-26T10:07:35Z,Paul,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/50f6977e00006400012d94d1
5,"overall cool software, not very competetive when i last checked, has its issues and limits, problems with security and development, but saying that, it is far superrior to the major players in the game, albeit it has somewhat limited scope from what i know. it does suit perfectly for small companies, with bigger ones, where costs of accounting is relatively high (be honest), others should be used, but up until this point it is cool, and actually predictable. once you learn to work around some limits, and be aware of security limitations (partly resolved from what i remember), this is cool. as an it guy, alto i have not used many others, but i have seen them and helped my customers, this one goes on top, we had so many problems with others its beyond my comprehension. this one at least does what it says on tin, and all core features work, like invoicing, mailing, payments (stripe now) and such. for the static price which, lets be honest, is extremely small nowdays, this is just a good deal. try it your self. if you like, you can use my referral link just add to the end of free agent domain ?referrer=45ehdk5q gives us 10% discount ;) if not, skip it ;) up to you. enjoy.",2019-11-26T10:06:13Z,Biz Customer,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5acb5b0d4de5666d3477410b
4,"The Customer Service agent replied within about an hour of me sending an enquiry by e-mail but, unfortunately, had to confirm that the feature I needed (live bank feed in real time) was not available and so the FreeAgent system was always up to a day behind. He did, however, say that he would log my point as a new feature request so my issue was taken seriously. The four stars rather than five reflect that my issue was not resolved but the service was very good.",2019-11-26T10:06:11Z,Mr Dean Harper,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ab3c1dd4de5666d3473330d
5,The package is excellent and keeps me informed about my company accounts. I have one request regarding the area where you can upload documents.

5,"It's probably the best software I've used for accounting, ever. But it's not just for accounting. I use it for every aspect of my company. Time keeping, sorted. Billing, easy! Managing tasks... well, I use Trello, and I don't think there's integration there, but hey, that's no big deal because all I do is select a project, select a task, and write in the description what job I'm working on, and click record. The payroll system has been a life saver, as has all the areas dealing with tax and the HMRC (annual returns and even self employment). The staff have always been there to speak to whenever I've needed help, and even if they don't have the exact answers I need, they can easily point me in the right direction. Best of all, I get it for free because of my business bank account (so it's worth a check to see if you get it for free).

After reviewing various software i chose this one as it deals with the flat rate scheme for VAT, is HMRC approved and seemed to be ideal for the type of company we have for making tax digital.

3,I've used Freeagent for quite a few years now and find it very good for my business. The BIG problem with the app is you can't search for a contact via their name. My business has hundreds of customers and to scroll through them all to find a customer is RUBBISH. It such a simple thing but renders the app useless for me and I can't use it. I've even message them and they are not changing it.,2019-11-15T19:40:48Z,Ben Treadaway,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/50e19fe500006400012bfe21

1,"During the trial I could connect to my bank through a third party application used by FreeAgent, then when the trial ended and after I subscribed I find out I can no longer do that and after asking for a refund they say they can cancel! Very disappointing and misleading if they had informed of the changes then I feel that would have been a different story so very poor service in my opinion. If you can no longer offer the service you think you are buying a refund should be issued.",2019-11-06T10:22:01Z,Traci Cornelius,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/54cfbb600000ff0001a849c5

4,As a 1 person consultancy I found this easy to use. The UI guides you through processes well and embodies quite a bit of accounting and tax knowledge. (can't say whether my accountant would agree or not).

It was massively daunting having to update to MTD and learn to us new software for VAT returns, but every single time I emailed Free Agent with a query, they were so helpful.

I think the Free Agent software is absolutely incredible, I had no idea it would make things so easy to file VAT returns with HMRC.

Random Vat amounts that dont calculate properly Trial balances that does not balance Bank Uploads that dont work The invoicing functionality is very poor. It does not support editing of the name of the company so if you are trading under another name ,their advice was get a programmer to do a invoice template for you-Go figure? The auto allocation functionality does seem to remember tranactions from last time either. At this point in time I have yet another call to their helpdesk and wasting yet more time on a VAt return that has not calculated properly.",2019-09-15T17:52:55Z,Barry j mccormack,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d542b6cc5d41fc763981225

4,Generally happy with the software. There are a few issues where it makes a bit of a meal out of carrying out relatively simple tasks. For example allocating credits to invoices. Also you cannot effectively post a supplier invoice with multiple lines and different nominal analysis.

Chose FreeAgent as I receive it through my business bank account. It's really easy to use and I've learned a lot about accounting in the process. I'm also using it for more jobs than I expected to - invoicing, expenses. The help notes are easy to use and if you do get stuck and need to get in touch with a person for a specific query - I've done it 3 times already! - a real person gets back to you by email really quickly with specific, helpful advice as well as other hints and tips to get the most out of the system.

It's a steep learning curve as this is definitely NOT my area of expertise, however, FreeAgent is well designed and fairly intuitive for a novice like me.

5,"As i had to submit my company VAT via MTD this past period, I had to choose an application to do this for me. I chose FreeAgent, for a number of reasons: They are based in the UK, and understand the quirks of our 'wonderful' HMRC; their support was highly rated (and boy, did I need them at the beginning!); their system is straightforward to use; you don't have to be an accountant, bookkeeper or have accountancy training to use it; it was created by people who ran small businesses, for small businesses; it had bank feeds; it had a high score in various review sites. I'm glad I did choose them because although setting up 9 months of company accounts, in order to be able to file the June VAT return was, frankly, hell - the customer support and the speed of that, made it better and more palatable to deal with. It was never going to be easy to have to put in 9 months of data from scratch. I was so grateful to all those customer support people that helped me with my probably very basic questions and queries, that I sent them a thank you email after I'd successfully filed! Going forwards - it is so great to be able to see your accounts as they unfold. It is easy to use, especially for a non accountant, once you've grasped the basics. They also have a very good introductory webinar, and I'm about to sign up for the advanced one. So far very happy with this, would highly recommend if you don't want to go with an American based system that has adapted their system to our UK quirks.",2019-08-14T16:14:45Z,Emfortee,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/4f3e12ea0000640001145119

It links in with your business account so everything is there on the screen, no manual entry needed. It also gives you reports and enables you to do vat and tax returns in a fraction of the time. I wish I had moved to them sooner.

5,"My motivation for moving to a cloud based accounting package was the MTD for VAT initiative. Previously I had been preparing my accounts using a part computerised and part manual process. To this end I was fairly confident of the features I needed and the type of transactions and volume I needed to manage. Initially I had reservations about selecting a cloud solution regarding tie in and recurring costs when compared to an on premise solution but having thought about it I decided that the benefit of cloud backup and up-to date software outweighed any such reservations. Prior to selecting FreeAgent I looked at other accounting packages in the market; some seemed more technical but more expensive, others were much cheaper but didn't have the features such a payroll or it was available as a bureau service at additional cost (it seemed to me). FreeAgent seemed to have the features I needed for a reasonable price. A key part of my selection process was to research how I could perform the different tasks I needed to do to manage my accounts, including on-boarding and the subsequent day to day tasks. In this respect I found that FreeAgent had the most complete and easiest to follow guidance. Where I wasn't sure how to achieve something on a platform I contacted the provider by email. I felt that the replies I got from FreeAgent were the most detailed and easiest to follow; responses were tailored, addressing each of my questions logically and concisely, and although I don't have any statistics to back this up my feeling is that they were quicker to respond; within a day, by my memory. Having ascertained that FreeAgent provided the set of features I needed and being impressed by the technical support I had received from them up to that point, and being fairly confident I knew what I needed to do regards on-boarding and thereafter, I signed up for the 30 day free trial. In reality I can't see how after 30 days of running your accounts on a platform you could contemplate switching so at this point I was happy to commit to using FreeAgent. I followed the guidance I found on the FreeAgent site for getting started with some confidence because I had already planned what I needed to do and confirmed some of the details of this plan with their technical support department by email. I started from a new financial year, part way through a VAT quarter and at the start of a new year for payroll. Initially the on-boarding process seemed daunting because you appear to have deadlines; you need to be able to invoice customers from the start, payroll needs to be set up within the month if you have a monthly payroll cycle because of the RTI constraint. Opening balances need to be finalised before the first VAT return can be made (MTD or otherwise) because the VAT opening balances are locked once you make your first submission and so on. In truth these deadlines are mostly illusory because there always seemed to be a plan B; payroll doesn't have to be run through the FreeAgent platform - the figures can be added as journal entries afterwards (I believe) so if you miss the first month or week there is a work round (use your old system and journal the figures across). In the end I stuck to my plan and the on-boarding process went quite smoothly to the point that I couldn't believe I hadn't done it years ago. I did have one minor moment of panic when I did my first RTI submission through FreeAgent. Only because FreeAgent sends both an FPS and an EPS record regardless of whether the EPS is required. The payroll package I used previously only sent an FPS. I feared because the EPS had been sent I'd done something wrong; not configured something in FreeAgent correctly or put the wrong figure in the wrong box (not sure how, its all straight forward but...), however a short phone call to the FreeAgent technical support line set my mind at ease. Again I have to say that even this episode confirmed that I'd made the right choice because although when I called they were busy, they phoned me back within a few minutes to resolve my issue. I've been using FreeAgent for a little under three months now and I'm still pleased with my choice; still pleased with FreeAgent. The day-to-day screens I use are easy to use. The UI is user friendly if you want to dig in to figures behind the dashboards then you can. Using FreeAgent has enabled me to streamline my accounting processes from invoice generation and payroll to bank reconciliation it has also enabled me to improve the quality of my accounts from the point of view that there is more clarity to the transaction I've recorded and receipts and invoices are attached to transaction rather than in a box file somewhere and this has been achieved with less effort and certainly my end of year doesn't look like it will be half as daunting as it used to be (why didn't I do this sooner?). If I were asked what improvements I would make to FreeAgent then I think there are two main areas I'd like to see improved; The online support and documentation is great; I've found most of what I needed to do by searching the online documentation and support forums. The problem I had with it is that it can be a bit disjointed - The getting started section is great but it only gets you so far but there are things you need to do to on-board that aren't directly in the path of the getting started docs - the information is there if you dig for it but I felt that what I was looking for, everyone (in my position) would probably want to do and so why not include the links to that material in that section. Also when I searched for information on some task I found my self in the FreeAgent forums reading multi-page threads following advice written years ago and thinking thats what I need to achieve but is it still the right way to go? The plus side to this is that its clear that the FreeAgent experts are monitoring and replying in the forums; providing the same level of quality support as they do through the other channels. My only thought here is that some of the guidance provided in the forums could be surfaced in the online documentation making it easier to find. Some of the questions I found answers to in the forums were of the nature how do I record this / which code do I use...? and coming from a non-accountancy background I have to say that I would like to see some deeper explanation of what the different categories are for and when to use them - some are obvious but others are not so. The other area where I'd like to see additional features is centred around My Money; FreeAgent keeps a separate track of the expenses you have claimed and are owed, your salary payments and your director's loan account. It keeps these as separate pots of money which is fine until you come to withdraw funds because AFAIKS there is no one report that tells you how much you can draw without going into debt. You can do some simple sums to arrive at the figure - but I'd like a simple view of what I'm owed without the hassle of doing the maths, my fear is that FreeAgent will automatically generate a dividend payment to cover the drawing - something I don't want to do. Because your funds are maintained in separate pots when you explain your drawings in the banking transactions you have to debit the separate pots individually - there is a smart payment function to help you do this but you never know how it will decide to apportion the debits between expenses and salary. What I would really like is if at the end of the month I could press a button and sweep any amounts that haven't been drawn into the director's loan account or to just do that anyway and then make any drawings from the DLA and avoid the smart payment multi-pots issue all together. This is a minor inconvenience though and could be there for good reason so I wouldn't let it detract from my overall position of a 5 star excellent rating",2019-06-22T15:42:43Z,Mark,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5d0e4c7336248b000bf6c8cb

4,"Been using Freeagent for a number of years and am really happy with them. Great support which always get back to me, and really useful for seeing how things are going financially. The only thing stopping me from giving the full 5 stars is issues with bank feeds in the past; they've messed up a few times and left me with a lot of manual clean up of numbers, and there's been no long term fix. Even so, I highly recommend them.",2019-06-18T12:56:33Z,Shaun,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5914252e0000ff000a96ec7c

4,Works well. Makes accounting easy for the novice but missing vital sections that would make P11D's easier such as tracking milage. Purchase orders are needed too.

1,"This morning I authorised Free Agent to renew my subscription on a monthly basis (previously I had been paying annually). Instead of debiting my card ¬£29 + VAT I was charged ¬£290 + VAT. I contacted Free Agent immediately and explained they had taken the wrong amount. It took most of the day to get any clear response, and in the end rather than agree to void the transaction before my account is debited, they are insisting on processing the transaction and refunding me in 5-10 days. I understand mistakes happen, but if you accidentally charge a customer's card ¬£300 and change too much, then you fix it on the spot. Or at least apologise. Or take an interest in how the problem occurred in the first place. I no longer trust Free Agent with my card details, and since this rating service is about trust, I have to give them one star.",2019-06-10T18:37:36Z,Ned Vaught,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5ace2da64de5666d34785770

3,I have used FreeAgent for over a year now and while I would say the first 6 month introductory price is worth the money I do not think that the regular price justifies what you get if your a single self employed sole trader. The self assesment filling has never worked for me which was one of the reasons I used this in the first place and neither would it let me enter the actual amount I paid in tax last year because it said it was wrong which it wasn't. After this tax year given how simple the process of filing my return manually was I will just be switching to using somthing like google docs or a desktop application to produce invoices and send them out manually and logging expenses. ¬£240 a year for the small number of invoices I do send this system isn't value for money in my opinion. Some might see this as being a cheapskate but I personally don't see the value for money in it for my situation anymore.,2019-03-01T13:22:19Z,Sam,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c7932094e343b829ed2029c
5,I run a craft supplies website as a sole trader and I tried many systems before finding Free Agent. They all had issues. Most forced me to create invoices for every sale which is madness when you run an online business with hundreds of sales every day. Others couldn't import paypal transactions in a sensible fashion that didn't require hours to sort out. Most were just ridiculously complex for such a simple business. FreeAgent has none of those issues. All my PayPal and bank transactions are automatically imported each night and all I have to do is a couple of clicks on each one to explain what it is. Takes me less than 10 minutes a day and I know exactly where I stand P&L wise every day now.,2019-03-01T09:48:45Z,Adrian Matthews,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5004586300006400011d5baf

Also, Stripe payments take 7 days to clear in our bank account, which is very inconvenient.

5,"As a sole trader, FreeAgent is absolutely fantastic the online portal and the iPhone App is easy and intuitive to use day to day. Out of 3 years of being a customer I have only had to call their team last week and can't say I've ever had better customer service and help in solving all of my issues, felt genuinely cared for as a customer. An example to other companies, would highly recommend.",2019-02-06T12:45:18Z,Andrew Wright,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/59b6d7d00000ff000ac79a6e

5,Their system is user-friendly and provides an accessible solution for managing the financials of our business. Their communiques are always well written and take the seriousness out of accounting.

My experience (and I've had plenty of queries over the last 3 or 4 years) is the support from the Edinburgh team is top quality and is the thing that stopped me exploring other vendors.,2019-02-06T12:25:49Z,Simon Wise,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c5ad24dff251f3acf7195b9

5,"Really easy, almost fun(!) way of keeping business accounts. Very helpful Scottish/English speaking UK-based support team. Reassuringly simple to enter information, submit digital VAT and other tax returns, expenses etc. Bank accounts live feed to Freeagent so it is always up to date. There are friendly weekly reminders to update information and also reminders for key dates such as VAT and tax returns etc. So much cheaper than a book keeper and frankly much more accurate than most. Presents accounts information clearly to the accountant, although if confident, one can submit corporation tax returns direct from FreeAgent without using an accountant.

5,"A must have for sole traders and businesses. For years I was using old fashioned spreadsheets, then tried various software solutions until someone recommended FreeAgent to me. I've now got a good chunk of my life back. January is no longer a horrible slog through receipts. I spend 5 minutes or less a week on my taxes and they are sorted. My accountant no longer has to chase me, I'm no longer stressed by the January deadline. Also you get a lifetime discount of 10% if you use my referral code (and I get 10% off too!): 44hd254a",2019-02-06T10:57:19Z,Jason,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c5abd8f618dfb4843997de2

5,"I decided to give FreeAgent a go, after struggling doing my book keeping on a laptop, and with pen and paper and calculator, for many years. Using FreeAgent has taken all of the hassle out of record keeping, invoicing and most importantly for me, the self assessment process. You can enter your tax return via FreeAgent, which uses all of your book keeping records you have entered through out the year. You can also send job quotes and keep a record of time keeping.

This is really intuitive, easy software that has all the functionality you need to operate in a sophisticated and professional way, and no unnecessary features confusing you. I'm someone who absolutely hates all admin and especially financial management, yet now I love entering all my project info every single day and seeing how the business is doing. I tested a few different systems and whole-heartedly recommend FreeAgent for sole traders and non-complex SME's. Extra points for no digital hype, BS or inane 'chat' on the UI, just plain and straightforward. Including the help section. Just what you need to know, as simply and briefly as possible.

Great that it can file VAT and Self Assessment returns, but I can't use the latter because it doesn't have the Property section (I can't be the only Self-employed person who also owns a Buy To Let property). And the Expenses functionality is behind competitors. But otherwise I love it.

Linking credit card bill is also a great enhancement. Only 2 asks - a better expense management process to capture photos of receipts at time of purchase and match to bank/credit card feeds when they arrive, rather than waiting, and to improve the flexibility around mileage expense claims for company car drivers (there are some !!) - its not always 45p",2019-01-24T22:38:10Z,Simon,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/58d03d6a0000ff000a83aba9

For me, as a freelancer, it is a great tool - not can I undertake all the standard book keeping functions, like invoicing, outgoing payments, bank integration etc, it also allows me to add personal expenses directly into the tool and set up client projects that I can record time against. When I generate an invoice for that project, the tool automatically aggregates any unbilled timesheets and expenses, which saves me loads of time in having to manually calculate sums due. I've used several accounting solutions over the years, including Sage and Quickfile, and this is by far the best for my business.",2019-01-22T10:16:07Z,Barry,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c46ed6798cdb4518c8bcd20

It's a little on the pricey side, but it is reliable, pretty easy to set up and use, has a great mobile app, access to webinars (stupid term!), makes tax returns extremely easy (providing the data is entered as you go) - mine took less than ten minutes from calculation to completed submission. You can link straight to your bank so you don't need to type all that data in, just confirm it's correct. Receipts, invoices and so on can be photographed and attached to expenses and payments immediately on the mobile app. The mobile app is much more limited than the desktop programme, so you can't just use your mobile for everything if that's what you want.",2019-01-18T08:45:07Z,Craig,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c4192125a53953eaca373b8

There are some awkward cases where it's not obvious, or actually possible, to do some of the things I'd like to do, which would make it easier to manage some aspects of my business. I've found it *very* reliable, and I *love* that I can download a complete archive of my accounts in a usable format.

5,I really do not know what i would do without Freeagent. I am a UK based self employed filmmaker and run my own production company which means that most of my time is taken up on the job. Accounts was always something that filled me with dread until I started using this software. It has a really user friendly interface and is clearly designed with people like me. It really does take most of the stress from the mundane responsibilities of book keeping. I in particular love the automation of Tax and PAYE which I think has saved my ¬£¬£¬£s in accounts fees. I know it's not a substitute for a clued up accountant but it really does help small businesses like mine manage essential accounts duties.,2019-01-16T17:19:28Z,Rad Miller,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f67a027721bddbcc7b76e

4,"Overall works well. Needs a way to add interest to overdue invoices. For example, if a client has 30 days to pay, then when they are 31+ days over due each reminder email should add a percentage of interest to the invoice for late payment, or something along those lines. Currently there is no way to do this, so there is no incentive from clients to pay on time. Plus this is a feature that users have been asking for for years, check the forums if you don't believe me. Also need to have a way to set defaults for invoices. I hate having to check all the same boxes etc every time I make an invoice, there should be a place to set the defaults so that it remember I always want settings x,y,z.",2019-01-16T16:00:29Z,Braeden,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f551d27721b60b6c79988

4,"Generally very good, easy to use, and great support. However i can't give it 5 stars because i do not believe Freeagent are investing enough in further development of the platform and continuous improvement. They have a solid product and they appear to be sticking with it, only making minor updates and improvements. They do not look like they are investigating or making significant improvements to keep pace with the market (e.g. integration with Power BI so we have more flexibility in visualising our data). This makes them good, but not great in my view. We are a growing business and can see ourselves outgrowing Freeagent before long.",2019-01-16T12:20:58Z,Andrew,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f21aa27721b3453c75321

4,"I started freelancing at the start of 2018, and FreeAgent has made the journey pretty much painless from the get-go. Useful, intuitive tools; quick support; reasonable monthly fee. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because some of the workflows are clunkier than I might have hoped for, and some of the finance overview isn‚Äôt particularly clear.

5,Great support and very intuitive software. My only gripe is that the Pre VAT (Sales Tax) total is not in bold as is the after sales tax total.

2,I've experienced a number of issues with FreeAgent in the recent months: - the automated bank feed with HSBC has numerous troubles. Has been down or intermittent for months; - the same feed is actually unreliable. when working on the corporate tax i noticed the system didn't import a couple of transactions 3 months back with no reason. i know the same happened with another colleague using FreeAgent; - the bonus paid to get the corporation tax option doesn't seem good value for money. The system should provide an easy way to compile a micro-entity return; - the content in the community and knowledge base is fairly poor. Again almost no into on how to consolidate accounts for a micro-entity based on the freeagent values. The process should be a lot clearer.,2019-01-16T10:53:16Z,Andrea,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f0d1b608f082c14e0501d

The package is Easy to use and has a good online and UK telephone helpline to sort out any queries, and of course rectify my cock ups. The key benefits for me I can give my accountant and others a limited or full access which is particularly useful come year end. VAT returns are very straight forward we just check we have entered all the receipts, and Freeagent will file my returns at the press of a button.",2019-01-16T10:49:45Z,RH Dedicated Sales ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f0c49e6dd32fe40c8ca59

4,"I think this is a really helpful, comprehensive programme, I've used it for a number of years. But I just went through 17/18 accounts for tax return and faced some issues. I uploaded my bank statements month by month. But as I started to fill in explanations I realised some entries were missing. So I went back, downloaded all my accounts again and re-uploaded them, about 100 inputs repeated themselves and I had to go through, find them and delete them. Think this is some sort of glitch maybe that it doesn't recognise them as I had renamed them? We also tried to use the phone app to upload receipts, this is a great feature and super fast, but about every 4-5 uploads when you click back to enter a new input it jumps all the way back to your most recent date and you have to scroll back down, if you are updating stuff from a year ago that's alot of scrolling and it stalls and reloads all the way through that. Another glitchy thing maybe. But in general, like I said I like alot of features, particularly the invoicing and be able to uplaod from bank account and assign invoices and receipts easily. Also love that it is a Scottish company and the Help section and advice bits are all really detailed.",2019-01-16T10:29:13Z,Amy,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f077927721b12b0c73383

5,"I love FreeAgent - it helps me keep track of all my finances easily, including reminding me of time I haven't billed for yet. I love that I can file my tax return straight from FreeAgent, and it tells me how much tax I owe and when to pay it. My only slight issue is that my bank feed takes a few days to update, but this is an issue with my bank not being supported by FreeAgent. But that's a small thing and all the other features more than outweigh it. Would highly recommend!",2019-01-16T10:21:49Z,Louise Misell,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5bffdc563bc0157231c08074

After my decision, I even stumbled upon an extra great reason to use FreeAgent... E): the support desk is free to use, incredibly kind, fast to respond, and has the knowledge to help you in one go! Oh, and being a Dutch citizen using UK software:F) invoices, outgoing emails, and reminder mails are all in my own language!",2019-01-16T10:13:26Z,Paul,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f03c627721ba5f2c72e04

3,The software is easy to use but I really dislike their pricing plan. If you're a lone trader it costs 420 per annum to use the software yet they do steep discounts if you recommend people (not much use if you're not part of a large network of contacts). They do discounts if you use certain accountants but not the one I use so it's hit and miss what you are charged compared to others. So according to their business plan you have two customers using the same software and being charged wildly different rates which does feel really unfair. (RE: the referral scheme - as mentioned above it's no good if you're not part of a large network of contacts).,2019-01-16T10:11:32Z,Ozzie,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c125d9dd22ed76b32cee051
5,"FreeAgent is excellent, as easy to use as you could hope for, and helps me run the financial side of my business with confidence, and without an accountant. I use it for my one-man business as a contractor and occasional freelancer providing engineering design services. With only one regular client, and few occasional freelance clients, my accounts aren‚Äôt complicated, but it‚Äôs still very much worth the money. As well as maintaining the accounts, it has very useful features like preparing and submitting VAT returns, and preparing all the info you need for tax returns - not only corporation tax, but the individual self-assessment income tax returns for all users too. For my business it does all I could want it to, easy to use and understand. For a different sort of business there may be limitations I can‚Äôt foresee, but it should work well for most small businesses.",2019-01-16T10:11:10Z,Richard,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/4df8b0000000640001093b1a
5,"I run a small web agency and Freeagent is a godsend. Started off using spreadsheet, then tried Sage (too complicated) and Quickbooks but FreeAgent is by far the easiest to use. The dashboard gives you an instant overview of your business, who owes you cash, tax timeline keeps you on the straight and narrow and their customer help desk are quick to help (same day)... When you sign up there is often a discount code available so have a look - if you use my referral code (42ahvh04) we both receive a 10% subscription discount....",2019-01-16T10:10:47Z,Tim,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/570239410000ff000a143306
3,Have been a great advocate of Freeagent in the past but recent ongoing problems when connecting to my HSBC account are making me rethink my approach. With Open Banking this should no longer be an issue - but it is. The processes for adding and updating Freeagent were good but the now seem rather clunky and not optimal My HSBC business account does not support contactless which is really important to me - so I will be reviewing my whole banking and accounting software solutions over the next few months - looking for far better and market leading solutions,2019-01-16T10:10:07Z,Richard,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f02fe608f08582fe040b2

4,"I love FreeAgent but the lack of properly integrated credit card feeds is a massive shortfall, and one that constantly has me eyeing up Xero as an alternative. I appreciate a third party provision was implemented, but frankly the notion of handing over my login to my Amex account represents the kind of security flaw that is page 1 on the things you should never do online manual.

It's simple, yet powerful - makes invoicing and VAT or Tax Returns the work of minutes, keeps track of invoices really easily, and provides clear information on who your best clients are, fastest payers etc. Takes seconds to set up a new client, then seconds to send estimates and invoices. Customer service is astonishingly good. They're super well informed, charming and very quick to respond.

5,"I have joined Freeagent a few months ago and it has literally changed my life. I used to be forever looking for receipts, trying to remember what certain payments were for. Now with the banking feed I can keep track of all this daily. It takes just a few minutes (or less) so I have made a habit of doing this first thing in the morning while I have my breakfast. No more painstakingly searching for receipts or trying to remember what payments were for, as it is all still so fresh in my memory I have every single penny accounted for since I'm using Freeagent. And I love how it remembers spending categories. Repeat payments to staff, suppliers, Freeagent automatically suggests the correct spending category which makes it so much easier to keep track of where the money goes. This also helps me to get a much better understanding of where I could (and should) make savings. The invoicing feature and connection to the bank feed is great too. Easy to keep track on who has or canst paid. Very happy overall.",2019-01-16T10:07:51Z,Morna Retreats Ibiza ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c3f0277ecc70ca05850fa30

5,"So, and without wanting to sound conceited, as a Chartered Management Accountant who specialises in the implementation of Financial Systems (albeit for larger companies) - and as someone who has previously used other systems (e.g. Sage, Quickbooks, Mamut, and, latterly Xero) to do my own books, I'd like to think I am well qualified to review FreeAgent... so, here goes ... It's good. Seriously good, in fact. Simple to set up (I migrated from Xero and was fully configured in under an hour) the application is quick and to intuitive to use. The online help is very good, and the support desk is frankly exceptional. There are also a decent and growing number of integrations with other cloud applications. Obviously, it is not going to suit all businesses, given the perfectly reasonable limitations on functionality (say, e.g. inventory management), so, if your business has complex back-office processes, you might want to look elsewhere... but for the needs of a simple business, it should tick the boxes easily. For a freelancer or contractor, it is nothing short of perfect. Totally perfect. It does payroll, projects (incl. time recording), basic multicurrency and other cool stuff 'out-of-the-box'. For equivalent functionality, I was paying Xero over ¬£45 per month. Oh, and it's a UK success story. What's not to love. I felt compelled to leave a review, only as I had read some of the (small number) of negative comments on here with some bemusement. Some of those guys clearly don't 'get it' and just need to seek the services of an accountant.",2019-01-11T13:43:48Z,Craig Turner,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5c389d7a463cfac638fa056f

1,"Extremely poor customer service and software/system has many issues such as the password reset functionality does not work and have to waste too much time with customer service who are nothing but helpless people. Email reply will take ages and also there is no concept of notification for Payroll, VAT and other services. Self Assessment take ages to update. Definitely need improvement to be competitive with the other products in the market",2018-12-07T09:52:32Z,Muhammad Iqbal,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/53d360f3000064000180fd9d

1,"No bank rec function. You cannot post to suspense from the bank. You cannot journal to the bank. You cannot input a receipt or sales invoice after a vat period has closed. You can only totally lock a period, not password protect or only allow a bookkeeper/accountant to amend, so the client can go in change things. No audit trail making it impossible to know what your client has done. I could go on! Great for small, simple businesses but QuickBooks Online is a million times better & half the price!",2018-08-06T16:44:32Z,MiriB,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/5b687aee4de5666d343a4be7
5,"Happy to recommend this company. They have a paid accountancy as a service software product which happens to be free if you are an RBS customer. They do not offer accountancy advice or filing or preparation of accounts however you have a large choice of freeagent compatible accountants for this so you can shop around and take your pick. This is potentially much better than an all in 1 bundled service because you have choice. The email support is exemplary, friendly and helpful and they think like a software development company (which they are) and give hints about upcoming releases and work in progress. The software is simple and easy to use and the bank integration works flawlessly. What's not to like?",2018-08-05T16:54:40Z,Craig,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/546731cc000064000196b4eb

3,Is what you expect from the price however there are flaws in the process especially vat and the help centre doesn‚Äôt match what the screen shows. Bank feeds are very often super slow or down.

1,"I definately do not agree with this review with respect to support. Provided that all you need is something simple then probably you will be happy with the level of support. However, I recently got locked out of my account, it has been 2 days now and I am still locked out of my account. I have had no update on when I can expect the issue to be resolved, other than a vague promise that I am in a queue, although no means apparently of identifying when my issue will come to the top of the queue and get dealt with. I am told the issue is not a support issue, it is a technical support issue! Support apparently have no insight in to a call once it has been forwarded to technical support and there is no access to technical support. No access to any complaints department, and no speaking to a manager. When I get access to my account I intend to do an export of my data and close my account and open an account with a company which is more customer orientated.",2018-02-21T16:52:54Z,Alan Warnett,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/575a904b0000ff000a27ed67
3,"Freeagent isn't perfect - but it's good if you're either new to bookkeeping and self-assessment filing or if you just want to make life easier. Whilst there are some flaws of Freeagent, it is a really easy and completely cloud-based system to keep the taxman happy! But unfortunately, that is really all it is good for. It has been very frequent for me that Freeagent's transaction detection is missing out a few transactions which has caused the balance of my banks and PayPal to show different figures to the ones Freeagent have detected. This has left me having to either add them myself, or riskily leave them, which kind of defeats the purpose of an automated bookkeeping service that is supposedly meant to be easier (especially when paying the recurring price that Freeagent sell their service for!) Their self-explanation feature is also hit-and-miss. It never seems to automatically explain a sale as a sale (weird, right?) no matter how many times I have explained previously similar transactions as a sale. As for outgoings or transferring funds from one account to another, I usually always have to explain these apart from a view that set a 'semi-explanation' which require human intervention before proceeding. The automation side of Freeagent needs to be heavily fixed. The price is also very high for what you receive, although this is to be expected as currently at the time of writing this review there is not any other reliable provider that files your tax return for you. But another positive is that their support is pretty good - they claim their accountants are not allowed to assist you with your bookkeeping explanations however some of them have slyly 'hinted' towards me what explanations 'could' be correct ;-) I have good faith that Freeagent will eventually develop to be more advanced and offer more features, but as of yet it is remaining a 3-star until they improve the services and features they have to offer.",2018-02-09T22:57:21Z,Ben Gough (Terrum),https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/4fd21e7300006400011ad453
5,"Imagine my surprise when I realised I'd been testing FreeAgent for 3 years... I actually love it, which I appreciate makes me sound very dull. Here's some reasons I've enjoyed running the financial duties of my business in that time. I hope you might find it useful or reassuring if you're considering FreeAgent for your business accounting: Ease of set-up Complete flexibility Integrates with my banking transactions automatically (Barclays) Automated explanations, and complete the rest on my iPhone app - on train, in bed etc. Superb reports fit for any accountant, better than many accountants' reports in fact Invoices look amazing and can be personalised, and the automatic chasing / thanking clients for payment is a delight to use Director/Owners' self assessments completed in a doddle - and for free as part of our subscription I had a think about the downsides to be thorough as I started this write up. In truth, I haven't found a fault yet - Roan the data guru there introduces great new reports and app features quite often, none of which have ever crossed my mind as being missing, but always greatly appreciated updates - latest I've just had an email about last week is the new customer sales report. Pricing is fair (not the cheapest), however you do absolutely get what you pay for, the business is UK based with excellent customer support. And there are 2 ways to reduce the cost, potentially to the point of being free: 1. pay annually to get 12 months for the price of 10 (as I recall that was the deal. I only spotted that within my billing options last year. 2. PLUS referring other great users can earn you, and the referred new customer, a 10% discount on the subscription fee for life! One day I hope they will be paying me, but that's a way off... Our 10% discount code is 44b11yog and if you found this review helpful, I'd love you to use or share our code. We'll benefit as well as you, and for that you'll have our eternal gratitude.

Plus my accountant is great with it - now he's freed up to give me detailed advice that he'd probably not bother to explain otherwise. And you can add expenses easily so you never miss anything. You can photograph receipts and upload. Seriously, why would you do anything else?",2017-04-05T20:48:02Z,Alison Lubbock ,https://uk.trustpilot.com/users/58e558000000ff000a8a1132

This lost me hundreds of hours and hundreds of pounds was wasted on a pointless service with far too many technical errors.
