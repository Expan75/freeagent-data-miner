2,I have really liked this program but very frustrated,I have really liked this program.  Though sometimes it is a bit confusing and more recently it lost all of my synced information and I have had to try to go back through ALL of my charges to explain them.  That has been extremely frustrating.
5,Easier to use than I thought,"Easier to use than I thought,  efficient and effective."
5,Success,We are very happy with FreeAgent. The clarity and simplicity are far superior to previous software. Back up has been first class and changeover seemless.
4,Wasn't expecting too much when i‚Ä¶,Wasn't expecting too much when i started but after some useful guidance from free agent staff I have found it very easy to use.
5,Very easy to use.,"Very easy to use.The app is fantastic, I travel a lot as passenger and find i can do most of my accounts on the move.I also use KashFlow for another business but I find it very limited and hard to use. I am considering swapping both to FreeAgent.If you are a Natwest business customer you get FreeAgent for Free"
5,Wouldn‚Äôt be without it,"Practical, intuitive and comprehensive features with great back up support. Indispensable."
5,Self Assessment made easy!!,Self Assessment made easy!!I love it love it... so many functions and easy to use. My only ask is to allow multiple selection of transactions. so if I have petrol expense from different gas stations.. allow me to select them all and allocate to appropriate category. (Forgive me if it is there and I have missed it!!)
4,I have been using FreeAgent for just‚Ä¶,"I have been using FreeAgent for just over a year now and I am very happy with it. Saves a lot of time and I really like the invoicing system all being linked in. As a farming business some of the payment explanations do not fit, buts as updates are frequently happening I guess this might improve ."
5,First year with FreeAgent,Easy to use and the software soon gets used to the scope of entries for the business. Good for reporting and professional looking invoicing and the VAT calculations and submissions are very helpful.
4,Certainly does all I need it to do,"Certainly does all I need it to do, easy now I know. Great back up of help to access, bit of a pain renewing permission for bank account access every 90 days, but does make life easier"
5,Top Notch,"Tried lots of different software over 26 years and decided to keep up with technology and go online, wish I had done it years ago, very easy to use and saves me lots of time as invoicing done on site."

3,Easy to use but no Cash Basis.,"I like the ease of use of Free Agent, but I'm disappointed that you don't have the option to do Cash Basis hence the one star dropped. I didn't know this when I started to use it."

5,It's revolutionary!,"Having run companies since the early 2000's, the advancement Freeagent brings to small businesses around an area which is normally a distraction and costly - is revolutionary. Cannot recommend the product and the team enough!"

5,Excellent solution for your business‚Ä¶,"Excellent solution for your business accounts and whenever I've had to contact for advice, it has always been dealt with superbly."
2,"Poor work-arounds for property developers, but the support is good","For the most part, the software is pretty easy to use, although it could be a lot more intelligent when it sees bills from the same contractor and should be able to guess what the purchase is for, and the vat rate, or it should allow templates to be set up for different contractors. The main bug-bear for me is as a property developer, I find the workarounds for CIS dreadfully cumbersome. In its defence, FreeAgent support staff are very good which is why I give it 2 stars not 1. Bear in mind once you have picked your software, it is such a pain to switch to another provider (enter all your transactions in again) that you need to get it right first time."
5,Brilliant customer service,"Brilliant customer service, queries answered, a great help especially in the initial few months transitioning onto the software"
3,Good once it's up and running,"Once up and running Free Agent handles my accounts (and MTD Vat returns) just fine .. it does the VAT return far better than I ever did manually.It is not really saving me any work as I still run my old spreadsheet based accounts in parallel.It is worrying however, that FreeAgent gets total access to your bank and credit card accounts and in some cases requires a complete copy of your login security information .. this is the fault of the banks more than Free Agent, I guess.Setting up Free Agent really needs the help of an accountant; there are are all kinds of ""start"" values that should be entered to set the baseline for accounting.  EG I was owed a VAT refund from HMRC for the months prior to starting to use Free Agent but never found a way to reclaim it using Free Agent and gave up.  Free support is available by ""bot"" and when that fails by email with an adviser, but I failed to understand much of the advice (which was in accountancy speak ""journal entries"" and ""Contra accounts"").My accountant says he is bombarded with so many different MTD packages that he can't possibly use the data from Free Agent (and all the others), so I still have to send end of year accounts as a spreadsheet.   I guess a combination of Free Agent and a Free Agent friendly accountant might be pretty good .. I'm looking into it... but then I'd worry that Free Agent will suddenly become very expensive (Currently it is free to RBS business customers - but no guarantee that will last) or go belly up and disappear."
4,Very handy program/app to have with a‚Ä¶,Very handy program/app to have with a small business. Yu can check most things on your phone and its handy to add in the odd 'on the move' payment.
5,I really like FreeAgent,"I really like FreeAgent. well, obviously I don't like the fact I have to pay for it and I could be more proactive in recruiting other users and therefore cutting my costs... but anyway, as a self employed person it's perfect. I pretty much do everything on my mobile - create and send invoices, reconciliation of bank, and all that other accounting jargon I don't really understand! it's really easy to use. I guess I would like some of the reports to be better [they know this, I've told them!] but overall I am super duper happy. oh, also the support is great, if you contact them they really do try to help in a timely manner [as the corporate folk say]. love it!"
2,I really liked free agent at first but‚Ä¶,I really liked free agent at first but now I am getting increasingly frustrated with the software continuously calculating my VAT return incorrectly. They have calculated a return based on a previous return that wasn't submitted via free agent and have assumed that I was on the Standard scheme when I have been on the flat rate scheme for a number of years. Instead of correcting they have advised to speak to my accountant or open a new account. This is not an effective or efficient solution. I suggest that if you are thinking of buying this product that you properly test it within the month trial as I am now having regrets.
3,No facility to prepare delivery notes‚Ä¶,"No facility to prepare delivery notes which, in my opinion, is a big oversight.  I did bring it to the companys attention, but sadly it fell on deaf ears."

5,Free Agent for business,"A very intuitive platform that lets me produce estimates and invoices, while keeping tabs on bank accounts with a feed of who has paid and what is outstanding. Then interfaces with HMRC for my VAT returns. A very clever product that I recommend."

5,Way better then Quickbooks!,"I tried quickbooks and yes I think they are cheaper but I found their system to be very complicated. I rang the customer service for help numerous times and always found them to be very rude and not very interested in helping.Freeagent on the other hand is so simple to use, there are tons of videos to help you and the customer service is great. I have a LTD company and its complicated to work things out but freeagent gives you that peace of mind that you are doing things properly. I highly recommend to anyone sole trader or limited company."

5,Wish I'd found this software years ago,"I've only been using Freeagent for a short period of time, however I find it much easier to understand and therefore use that some of the other software out there. The help section is great and so far I've always found an easy way of doing what I need to do, so glad I moved from one of the major packages, only wish I'd found this product sooner.Looking forward to exploring its capabilities over the new few months."
5,Really useful and great customer service!,"I've been using for 3 years now. Has transformed accounting for my small business. And - best of all, when I had a glitch with a bank feed the customer service team were so helpful, actually outstanding. Bravo!"
5,Surprisingly simple and intuitive,"I'd been dreading the time i had to go digital with my accounts. My trusty XL sheet had kept me more than happy for the past 10 years. Saw this software recommended so thought I could at least trial it and then delete it. Totally suprised by how good it is. The help files are fantastic. It is, like all software a little overwhelming to start but within an afternnon I'd got my Bank , Paypal and cash accounts sorted, new invoices created and sent.If like me you are a technophobe, and have tried and deleted the others then give this a go! As a sole trader its perfect for my business!"

The latter is particularly valuable as some accounting packages I have used in the past have seemed to enjoy putting a barrier of understanding between non professionals and themselves, presumably to maintain the mystique of accountancy! Thankfully Freeagent like you to be able to work their software!"

5,General Review,"FreeAgent is a very easy to use accounting system that meets all the basic functionality that you need.The help service is fantastic if you do have queries or need a little more explanation or guidance.  The help library is very good but the online help is fantastic.  Really helpful answers or if the system cannot do something you are looking for (say creating an invoice with lines from the account headings such as Hotels, Car Parking etc consolidated) then if they think its a good idea then they will put it to the development team or tell you another way if possible or that it can't be done.  Straight forward and honest!It's very easy for employees to record expenses onto the system and post receipts using the mobile app.The system cannot produce your Accounts for filing at companies house so you need other software - likewise for Corporation Tax (CT) submissions. However, I like the fact that the system does produce your basic CT computation and does the automatic accounting entries for this.  It would be great if Accounts and CT filing could be integrated just like RTI for payroll or VAT filing is integrated currently.Overall for small and medium sized business this is a great package."
5,Makes life so much easier,"Easy to use, with excellent, personalised support from friendly, expert staff. I couldn't be happier with FreeAgent - it makes accounting and tax returns so much more straightforward."

5,I can‚Äôt really fault FreeAgent,I can‚Äôt really fault FreeAgent - it works well and has always been up and running whenever I have wanted to use it.
5,Great for freelancers,I work as a freelancer in the events industry and it's pretty perfect. The invoices look professional and I love that you can style them with CSS. Then how it syncs with multiple bank accounts is perfect as you can assign expenses to projects and add your receipts. Plus of course it helps out massively with the tax return.I'm not going back to the spreadsheet days as it often meant mistakes were made copying information and keeping track of expenses just isn't fun.There are only a few minor workflow issues it would be great if they fixed.
5,Great help,FreeAgent is an indispensable tool that saves so much time and should really help any small business.

5,Great Experience!,Excellent customer service when making a recent inquiry about historical account that was removed from my former accountants' dashboard.  They helped with ensuring everything was as it should be with intact data and for regaining my access to an old account for which I had not only forgotten the password but the former email address was no longer in use for several years.  The operators who I spoke with to help me were professional and a credit to FreeAgent.  Keep up the good work.
4,"Good platform, but old design terrible reports","I enjoy using FreeAgent. But I find the platform to poorly designed and to have a lot less fress and modern layout. Also, the reporting tools are lacking and not something I even using."

5,Very good customer services,Very good customer services
4,Great to use,"Whilst the portal is extremely easy to use and bearing in mind that I use various accounting portals (and by the way I really like Freeagent), it seems to me that some extra features need to be added. For instance:1. Non sterling bank accounts should allow explanations entered as money paid to user.2. There must be an option to change the accounting reference.3. The VAT deregistration process could be made a bit clearer now that MTD for VAT is in force. We have a client who's required to file a final return but the submission keeps failing. Freeagent's been contacted but no progress. We'll keep trying until this works of course.4. Accounting reports - perhaps more needed when it comes to management accounts, esp with cashflow forecasts, budgeting etc.5.  Bank feed issue - with open banking I think that there should have been slightly more done, for example, an automatic email or reminder sent out to the primary account holder. Or in the event that the feeds do not work or stall, the primary account holder gets notification immediately.There are some more things that I'd like to add but I believe this is best dealt with on a case by case basis.To reiterate, Freeagent is amazing and really simple and I like it a lot but I, personally, feel a bit more is needed."
5,Freeagent is a fabulous service,Freeagent is a fabulous service - the software makes our lives running a small business SO much easier and our accountant and tax advisors love it.But the service from the support team is the best I've EVER experienced over many years and they should be really proud of the standard they achieve.  Just wonderful.I thoroughly recommend Freeagent without any reservation and hope they go from strength to strength.  They really deserve to.

2,Improving FreeAgent,"Some aspects are very good. There are areas where functionality is poor or limited. Data (reports) tend to be ""chopped up"" into ranges by date or other groupings, where a complete listing would be helpful. A simple ""select by date range"" would solve itDisabling access after only 7 days from a late payment is totally unacceptable. I suspect it may well make FA liable in damages for any harm that results from the said action.(Note:  these comments are somewhat hastily compiled and may be misleading)"

Feature-wise, it is very similar to other well-known accounting packages and offers all of the technical wizardry that is expected these days i.e. Open Banking Bank Feeds, Integrations with Payment Systems etcThe reason it is so good is down to two aspects: 1) The simplicity of the system and 2) the support that FreeAgent provides through its customer service function.  By spending an hour or so each week on the system, you can soon gain complete control over your business finances and when it comes to preparing accounts, FreeAgent has an Accountant Directory of Accountants who support the software and can take the figures and produce your Accounts and Tax Returns."

5,Good to enter stuff but for accounting side zero help,"RE-EDITING - 3-stars is given not because of their customer service which is good - polite and patient team and just okay application but because if you really intend to run your own accounting as a small business or limited company, like me, you can pull your hair and lose lots of hours/time and not get a straight answer from software - as navigation and documentation is poorly designed in my view but not terrible but just not helpful in my view and does not help to abide by HMRC rules and order of things need to be done. They really shy away from any even standard accounting advice. Also, be careful, sometimes different areas don't sync/refresh so see all fields carefully before submitting returns. It seems like at first at least, till you learn, you may need  accounting hire. I used one of their recommended accountant on the phone as I had a very simple one thing left (after pulling my hair and wasting away time for a month) and accountant was really nice. It is just that consider if  cost of freeagent to you  if any, and to save sanity, time, and not to get fined by the cruel HMRC, you may benefit from their recommended accountant. Or, just going to an accountant to do all for you.."

5,Support bot is fine.  Transaction classification a bit unwieldy.,It was an automated response but they guessed what it was I wanted to do and I was done pretty easily.It's a bit of a ballache classifying a lot of transactions and some inline help on what each option means would be useful but that's what we're paying accounts for right?  I mean since this s/w arrived they do pretty much do stuff all anyway.
5,overall cool software,"overall cool software, not very competetive when i last checked, has its issues and limits, problems with security and development, but saying that, it is far superrior to the major players in the game, albeit it has somewhat limited scope from what i know. it does suit perfectly for small companies, with bigger ones, where costs of accounting is relatively high (be honest), others should be used, but up until this point it is cool, and actually predictable. once you learn to work around some limits, and be aware of security limitations (partly resolved from what i remember), this is cool. as an it guy, alto i have not used many others, but i have seen them and helped my customers, this one goes on top, we had so many problems with others its beyond my comprehension. this one at least does what it says on tin, and all core features work, like invoicing, mailing, payments (stripe now) and such. for the static price which, lets be honest, is extremely small nowdays, this is just a good deal. try it your self. if you like, you can use my referral link just add to the end of free agent domain ?referrer=45ehdk5qgives us 10% discount ;) if not, skip it ;) up to you. enjoy."
4,Good and Prompt Response,"The Customer Service agent replied within about an hour of me sending an enquiry by e-mail but, unfortunately, had to confirm that the feature I needed (live bank feed in real time) was not available and so the FreeAgent system was always up to a day behind. He did, however, say that he would log my point as a new feature request so my issue was taken seriously. The four stars rather than five reflect that my issue was not resolved but the service was very good."

I use it for every aspect of my company.Time keeping, sorted.  Billing, easy!  Managing tasks... well, I use Trello, and I don't think there's integration there, but hey, that's no big deal because all I do is select a project, select a task, and write in the description what job I'm working on, and click ""record"".The payroll system has been a life saver, as has all the areas dealing with tax and the HMRC (annual returns and even self employment).The staff have always been there to speak to whenever I've needed help, and even if they don't have the exact answers I need, they can easily point me in the right direction.Best of all, I get it for free because of my business bank account (so it's worth a check to see if you get it for free).((If you're confused by the title, it's because I was working on my own in-house system, but FreeAgent just did everything I needed and more))"

I am hopeful this will be sorted out before we have to file via the software."

3,Great on the desktop but App is not good!,I've used Freeagent for quite a few years now and find it very good for my business.The BIG problem with the app is you can't search for a contact via their name.My business has hundreds of customers and to scroll through them all to find a customer is RUBBISH.It such a simple thing but renders the app useless for me and I can't use it.I've even message them and they are not changing it.
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic, the customer support with FreeAgent is amazing. Webinars to help you out, the knowledge base if you have an FAQ - great. Well done"
5,Very disappointing and misleading,"During the trial I could connect to my bank through a third party application used by FreeAgent, then when the trial ended and after I subscribed I find out I can no longer do that and after asking for a refund they say they can cancel!Very disappointing and misleading if they had informed of the changes then I feel that would have been a different story so very poor service in my opinion.  If you can no longer offer the service you think you are buying a refund should be issued."

It was massively daunting having to update to MTD and learn to us new software for VAT returns, but every single time I emailed Free Agent with a query, they were so helpful.

I think the Free Agent software is absolutely incredible, I had no idea it would make things so easy to file VAT returns with HMRC. I can't believe that I actually enjoy bookkeeping now!"

I've never been surprised by a nasty tax bill because I know how exactly how much I need to keep aside for my tax return. It was really easy to learn how to use and as a result, I've not had an unpaid invoice because FreeAgent helps me keep on top of things. I'd recommend it to anyone taking their first steps into self-employment."
5,Great service,I've used Freeagent support a few times both by phone and email support. The team are always super helpful and friendly. This week I found I only had access to online support but was delighted at how quickly I got a response that provided exactly what I needed. Great service.

It does not support editing of the name of the company so if you are trading under another name ,their advice was get a programmer to do a invoice template for you-Go figure?The auto allocation functionality does seem to remember tranactions from last time either.At this point in time I have yet another call to their helpdesk and wasting yet more time on a VAt return that has not calculated properly."

5,I'd be lost without it!,"I've been using FreeAgent for approximately 5 years, I think, and I would be lost without it. The app is really user-friendly, and I love how easy it is to submit my accounts to HMRC at the end of the year. On the few occasions that I've needed assistance, I've had an almost immediate response with helpful information. Highly recommended."
5,Generally happy with the software.,Generally happy with the software.There are a few issues where it makes a bit of a meal out of carrying out relatively simple tasks. For example allocating credits to invoices. Also you cannot effectively post a supplier invoice with multiple lines and different nominal analysis. But generally for a simple operation it works ok
5,Made a difficult job much easier ..,"Made a difficult job much easier ... And almost pleasant!Forced to adopt some form of accounting software due to Making Tax Digital.  Chose FreeAgent as I receive it through my business bank account.  It's really easy to use and I've learned a lot about accounting in the process.  I'm also using it for more jobs than I expected to - invoicing, expenses.  The help notes are easy to use and if you do get stuck and need to get in touch with a person for a specific query - I've done it 3 times already! - a real person gets back to you by email really quickly with specific, helpful advice as well as other hints and tips to get the most out of the system.  Highly recommended."
5,Helpful for a novice!,"I've recently set up as a Sole Trader and chose FreeAgent on the recommendation of my accountant.  It's a steep learning curve as this is definitely NOT my area of expertise, however, FreeAgent is well designed and fairly intuitive for a novice like me.  The helpline is good, the help search function works well, and the various articles and emails are really useful.  My only criticism is the convoluted route to link my Starling account; but I suspect that is more to do with the bank than FreeAgent."
5,Definitely recommend this lot!,"As i had to submit my company VAT via MTD this past period, I had to choose an application to do this for me. I chose FreeAgent, for a number of reasons: They are based in the UK, and understand the quirks of our 'wonderful' HMRC; their support was highly rated (and boy, did I need them at the beginning!); their system is straightforward to use; you don't have to be an accountant, bookkeeper or have accountancy training to use it; it was created by  people who ran small businesses, for small businesses; it had bank feeds; it had a high score in various review sites. I'm glad I did choose them because although setting up 9 months of company accounts, in order to be able to file the June VAT return was, frankly, hell - the customer support and the speed of that, made it better and more palatable to deal with. It was never going to be easy to have to put in 9 months of data from scratch. I was so grateful to all those customer support people  that helped me with my probably very basic questions and queries, that I sent them a thank you email after I'd successfully filed! Going forwards - it is so great to be able to see your accounts as they unfold. It is easy to use, especially for a non accountant, once you've grasped the basics. They also have a very good introductory webinar, and I'm about to sign up for the advanced one. So far very happy with this, would highly recommend if you don't want to go with an American based system that has adapted their system to our UK quirks."

5,Free Agent is brilliant,"This is the first accounting software that is actually simple and easy to use and I've tried a few. The UI is incredibly intuitive and the whole process very fast. It links in with your business account so everything is there on the screen, no manual entry needed. It also gives you reports and enables you to do vat and tax returns in a fraction of the time. I wish I had moved to them sooner. I just had reason to ask for support and a lady there called Kirsten not only helped me out very quickly, but actually called me back when I made a simple error to correct it. Brilliant service."
5,It is a useful and save-timer web-app,"It is a useful and save-timer web-app, well done and keep developing it.BestAlfredo"
5,FreeAgent - Why didn't I do this sooner?,"My motivation for moving to a cloud based accounting package was the MTD for VAT initiative. Previously I had been preparing my accounts using a part computerised and part manual process. To this end I was fairly confident of the features I needed and the type of transactions and volume I needed to manage.Initially I had reservations about selecting a cloud solution regarding tie in and recurring costs when compared to an on premise solution but having thought about it I decided that the benefit of cloud backup and up-to date software outweighed any such reservations.  Prior to selecting FreeAgent I looked at other accounting packages in the market; some seemed more technical but more expensive, others were much cheaper but didn't have the features such a payroll or it was available as a bureau service at additional cost (it seemed to me). FreeAgent seemed to have the features I needed for a reasonable price.A key part of my selection process was to research how I could perform the different tasks I needed to do to manage my accounts, including on-boarding and the subsequent day to day tasks. In this respect I found that FreeAgent had the most complete and easiest to follow guidance. Where I wasn't sure how to achieve something on a platform I contacted the provider by email. I felt that the replies I got from FreeAgent were the most detailed and easiest to follow; responses were tailored, addressing each of my questions logically and concisely, and although I don't have any statistics to back this up my feeling is that they were quicker to respond; within a day, by my memory.Having ascertained that FreeAgent provided the set of features I needed and being impressed by the technical support I had received from them up to that point, and being fairly confident I knew what I needed to do regards on-boarding and thereafter, I signed up for the 30 day free trial. In reality I can't see how after 30 days of running your accounts on a platform you could contemplate switching so at this point I was happy to commit to using FreeAgent. I followed the guidance I found on the FreeAgent site for getting started with some confidence because I had already planned what I needed to do and confirmed some of the details of this plan with their technical support department by email. I started from a new financial year, part way through a VAT quarter and at the start of a new year for payroll. Initially the on-boarding process seemed daunting because you appear to have deadlines; you need to be able to invoice customers from the start, payroll needs to be set up within the month if you have a monthly payroll cycle because of the RTI constraint. Opening balances need to be finalised before the first VAT return can be made (MTD or otherwise) because the VAT opening balances are locked once you make your first submission and so on. In truth these deadlines are mostly illusory because there always seemed to be a plan B; payroll doesn't have to be run through the FreeAgent platform - the figures can be added as journal entries afterwards (I believe) so if you miss the first month or week there is a work round (use your old system and journal the figures across). In the end I stuck to my plan and the on-boarding process went quite smoothly to the point that I couldn't believe I hadn't done it years ago.I did have one minor moment of panic when I did my first RTI submission through FreeAgent. Only because FreeAgent sends both an FPS and an EPS record regardless of whether the EPS is required. The payroll package I used previously only sent an FPS. I feared because the EPS had been sent I'd done something wrong; not configured something in FreeAgent correctly or put the wrong figure in the wrong box (not sure how, its all straight forward but...), however a short phone call to the FreeAgent technical support line set my mind at ease. Again I have to say that even this episode confirmed that I'd made the right choice because although when I called they were busy, they phoned me back within a few minutes to resolve my issue.I've been using FreeAgent for a little under three months now and I'm still pleased with my choice; still pleased with FreeAgent. The day-to-day screens I use are easy to use. The UI is user friendly if you want to dig in to figures behind the dashboards then you can.  Using FreeAgent has enabled me to streamline my accounting processes from invoice generation and payroll to bank reconciliation it has also enabled me to improve the quality of my accounts from the point of view that there is more clarity to the transaction I've recorded and receipts and invoices are attached to transaction rather than in a box file somewhere and this has been achieved with less effort and certainly my end of year doesn't look like it will be half as daunting as it used to be (why didn't I do this sooner?). If I were asked what improvements I would make to FreeAgent then I think there are two main areas I'd like to see improved; The online support and documentation is great; I've found most of what I needed to do by searching the online documentation and support forums. The problem I had with it is that it can be a bit disjointed - ""The getting started"" section is great but it only gets you so far but there are things you need to do to on-board that aren't directly in the path of the getting started docs - the information is there if you dig for it but I felt that what I was looking for, everyone (in my position) would probably want to do and so why not include the links to that material in that section. Also when I searched for information on some task I found my self in the FreeAgent forums reading multi-page threads following advice written years ago and thinking thats what I need to achieve but is it still the right way to go? The plus side to this is that its clear that the FreeAgent experts are monitoring and replying in the forums; providing the same level of quality support as they do through the other channels. My only thought here is that some of the guidance provided in the forums could be surfaced in the online documentation making it easier to find. Some of the questions I found answers to in the forums were of the nature ""how do I record this / which code do I use...?"" and coming from a non-accountancy background I have to say that I would like to see some deeper explanation of what the different categories are for and when to use them - some are obvious but others are not so. The other area where I'd like to see additional features is centred around ""My Money"";  FreeAgent keeps a separate track of the expenses you have claimed and are owed, your salary payments and your director's loan account. It keeps these as separate pots of money which is fine until you come to withdraw funds because AFAIKS there is no one report that tells you how much you can draw without going into debt. You can do some simple sums to arrive at the figure - but I'd like a simple view of what I'm owed without the hassle of doing the maths, my fear is  that FreeAgent will automatically generate a dividend payment to cover the drawing - something I don't want to do. Because your funds are maintained in separate pots when you explain your drawings in the banking transactions you have to debit the separate pots individually - there is a smart payment function to help you do this but you never know how it will decide to apportion the debits between expenses and salary. What I would really like is if at the end of the month I could press a button and sweep any amounts that haven't been drawn into the director's loan account or to just do that anyway and then make any drawings from the DLA and avoid the smart payment multi-pots issue all together. This is a minor inconvenience though and could be there for good reason so I wouldn't let it detract from my overall position of a 5 star excellent rating"
5,great product.,great product.. but i only need software for a VAT return
5,I love this app as much as you can ever‚Ä¶,I love this app as much as you can ever love accounts in general....
4,Great tool,"Been using Freeagent for a number of years and am really happy with them. Great support which always get back to me, and really useful for seeing how things are going financially.The only thing stopping me from giving the full 5 stars is issues with bank feeds in the past; they've messed up a few times and left me with a lot of manual clean up of numbers, and there's been no long term fix.Even so, I highly recommend them."
5,Great service for my accounts,"Great service for my accounts - easy to use, 1-2 hours a month keeps on top of everything. Then easy to submit self assessment at year end."
4,"Works well  makes life easy, but missing vital areas.",Works well. Makes accounting easy for the novice but missing vital sections that would make P11D's easier such as tracking milage. Purchase orders are needed too. The app works well and the full desktop version is available from your photo which makes like easier.Many more tweaks are needed to get 5 stars.
3,Not user friendly,"Without specific programming knowledge, impossible to create your own personalised invoice as per word document, not even to increase font size. No auto fill facility on stock items used on mobile app. Other aspects seem fine, but the two negatives mentioned stop me using invoicing and quoting facility"
5,Unauthorised payment taken from my card,"This morning I authorised Free Agent to renew my subscription on a monthly basis (previously I had been paying annually). Instead of debiting my card ¬£29 + VAT I was charged ¬£290 + VAT. I contacted Free Agent immediately and explained they had taken the wrong amount. It took most of the day to get any clear response, and in the end rather than agree to void the transaction before my account is debited, they are insisting on processing the transaction and refunding me in 5-10 days.I understand mistakes happen, but if you accidentally charge a customer's card ¬£300 and change too much, then you fix it on the spot. Or at least apologise. Or take an interest in how the problem occurred in the first place.I no longer trust Free Agent with my card details, and since this rating service is about trust, I have to give them one star."
5,Really Good!,"Really, really, really good!I get Freeagent through Natwest.It's intuitive, easy to use, flexible, clear, and perfect for accounting numbskulls like me! ;-)Recommend it very highly!"
5,Excellent app,"Excellent app - makes accounting for a small business much less painful than alternatives like Quick Books. First class support for UK things like VAT, PAYE etc too."

4,Makes things so much easier.,"So far so good. For sole traders, this is just the ticket. Doesn‚Äôt feel unnecessarily complicated; the help is clear and easy to understand. Labelling your payments and invoices, easy. Takes me so much less time than my previous software. There‚Äôs always little tweaks that would be great:- products coming up as you type when entering items on invoices would be fab- being able to personalise the wording on invoices and where the columns are Just a bit more personalisation. Overall - very impressed."
5,FreeAgent,Super product. Very easy to use and full of functionality. Top rated and the best I have used. Support team are very helpful and responsive
5,It's an awesome solution,It's an awesome solution that's really easy to use. Cyprus sadly doesn't have any bak integrations so uploading statements is a pain. Also the lack of support for transverse statements can be slow and not easy to do. Would be awesome to add support for transverse statements.
5,Just a great product,Just a great product! I am always impressed with the way the team stays ahead of the curve! Plus it is intuitively simple and great value!Well done!
4,Generally very good but one missing feature,Only disappointment so far is that payroll doesn‚Äôt seem to support payrolling BIK for company cars.  So I won‚Äôt be able to use FreeAgent payroll and will need to keep on using HMRC ‚Äòbasic PAYE tools‚Äô.  I would have expected FreeAgent to at least maintain feature parity with BPT.
5,Great software and excellent support‚Ä¶,Great software and excellent support team. You can do all of your taxes as a sole trader using this software without any prior knowledge of how it all works. Makes something stressful and complicated really pain free.

5,Excellent,"Excellent, keeps you up to date with HMRC changes :-)"
5,Excellent software,"Excellent software, I suggest dumping spreadsheets and Sage and go for FreeAgent"
3,Not worth the money as a single sole trader.,"I have used FreeAgent for over a year now and while I would say the first 6 month introductory price is worth the money I do not think that the regular price justifies what you get if your a single self employed sole trader. The self assesment filling has never worked for me which was one of the reasons I used this in the first place and neither would it let me enter the actual amount I paid in tax last year because it said it was wrong which it wasn't.After this tax year given how simple the process of filing my return manually was I will just be switching to using somthing like google docs or a desktop application to produce invoices and send them out manually and logging expenses.¬£240 a year for the small number of invoices I do send this system isn't value for money in my opinion. Some might see this as being a ""cheapskate"" but I personally don't see the value for money in it for my situation anymore."
5,So glad I found FreeAgent,I run a craft supplies website as a sole trader and I tried many systems before finding Free Agent. They all had issues. Most forced me to create invoices for every sale which is madness when you run an online business with hundreds of sales every day. Others couldn't import paypal transactions in a sensible fashion that didn't require hours to sort out. Most were just ridiculously complex for such a simple business.FreeAgent has none of those issues. All my PayPal and bank transactions are automatically imported each night and all I have to do is a couple of clicks on each one to explain what it is. Takes me less than 10 minutes a day and I know exactly where I stand P&L wise every day now.
5,I can highly recommend FreeAgent,I can highly recommend FreeAgent - I‚Äôve been using it for 5+ years and it‚Äôs been great for productivity

4,Good financial software for small‚Ä¶,"Good financial software for small business owners, including project-level timeslips. Can input all expenses and upload receipts; create estimates and invoices; generate dividend certificates. Can't do everything perfectly in terms of working out tax, but other features work well. It's possible to give your accountant a login, so they can see all your transactions within FreeAgent. Referral scheme is good too."

5,Best accounting software I have used,"Best accounting software I have used. The overview dashboard has to be the best in the industry. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that Stripe integration button on the client invoices states ‚Äúcredit card‚Äù, when most of our customers pay by debit card. This can confuse them. Also, Stripe payments take 7 days to clear in our bank account, which is very inconvenient. I do wish Freeagent would integrate more payment gateway options, so that businesses have a choice as to which one they use. Other than that, the software itself is excellent and I highly recommend for any limited company."
5,FreeAgent Makes Bookkeeping Easy,"FreeAgent makes bookkeeping for my small business very easy and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for help in this area. The interface is clear and logical, and can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection . . . no need to download software to your computer."
3,It's fine but it could be better.,"It's adequate but it's limited by the lack of functions that other similar companies are offering that would help automate my client processes. For example, automatically adding a late fee charge to my invoices so I don't have to keep redrafting my invoices and having to send my own reminders out."
5,Good,"Good, it works well, and I'm happy all my business (3) use this software.."
5,Could not manage without FreeAgent!,"I have used FreeAgent for a number of years. I am self-employed and it enables me to keep on top of my work finances, create and send quotes and invoices, record payments etc. Also whenever I have needed any help, it has been available without delay."

4,Great software to keep track of‚Ä¶,Great software to keep track of everyday buisness accounts. Invoice funtion could be better if it had more options. Templates are a bit limited as to layout and functions.
3,FreeAgent has all of the basics we need‚Ä¶,FreeAgent has all of the basics we need but some more advanced functionality when customizing content for estimates and invoices would be helpful. A way to tally time cards by person or task would be a great feature as well as the ability to choose a client contact name for estimates and invoices from a dropdown menu rather than trying to remember to enter the name in the override field.
5,Stuart was very helpful,"Stuart was very helpful, very knowledgable on the issue I called about, and helped me understand my options clearly. Communication with FreeAgent is always quick, and reliable, and they never make you feel like your asking a stupid question. Follow up is also excellent."

5,Used for consultancy limited company,"Used for consultancy limited company. Comprehensive features, well designed and easy to use, excellent support."
4,Ultimate book keeping system for freelancers!,"Great system, the only choice for freelancers I feel, especially if LTD.My only complaint is it needs work on estimates / quotes. Especially on discounting as at there isn‚Äôt a line item option for that, you have set a service or product as a negative figure and name it discount in the desciption which looks naff.Similarly on an invoice discounts go in as a separate item/row, rather than a column to be able to apply individual discounts to line items"

An example to other companies, would highly recommend."
5,FreeAgent a must for Freelancers!,As a sole trader FreeAgent allows me to keep track of my finances in real-time and also makes filing your self-assessment to HMRC extremely easy. They have a great customer service team who will get back to you within 24 hours too.
5,Their system is user-friendly and‚Ä¶,Their system is user-friendly and provides an accessible solution for managing the financials of our business. Their communiques are always well written and take the seriousness out of accounting.FreeAgent transformed our business and allows us to respond to client statement requests and provides automated reminders to chase outstanding payments.

5,Product improving all the time,Product improving all the time. Really surprised by the reviews suggesting support is poor. My experience (and I've had plenty of queries over the last 3 or 4 years) is the support from the Edinburgh team is top quality and is the thing that stopped me exploring other vendors.

5,Really easy and user friendly,"Really easy, almost fun(!) way of keeping business accounts.Very helpful Scottish/English speaking UK-based support team. Reassuringly simple to enter information, submit digital VAT and other tax returns, expenses etc. Bank accounts live feed to Freeagent so it is always up to date.  There are friendly weekly reminders to update information and also reminders for key dates such as VAT and tax returns etc. So much cheaper than a book keeper and frankly much more accurate than most. Presents accounts information clearly to the accountant, although if confident, one can submit corporation tax returns direct from FreeAgent without using an accountant. We haven't quite got there yet!"

Using FreeAgent has taken all of the hassle out of record keeping, invoicing and most importantly for me, the self assessment process.

5,So easy to use and makes painful tasks fun!,"I can't think of almost anything to change about the software. (Except maybe automatic reading of receipts for expenses on the app)!This is really intuitive, easy software that has all the functionality you need to operate in a sophisticated and professional way, and no unnecessary features confusing you. I'm someone who absolutely hates all admin and especially financial management, yet now I love entering all my project info every single day and seeing how the business is doing.I tested a few different systems and whole-heartedly recommend FreeAgent for sole traders and non-complex SME's.Extra points for no digital hype, BS or inane 'chat' on the UI, just plain and straightforward. Including the help section. Just what you need to know, as simply and briefly as possible. No artificial 'engagement'."
4,Best functionality of the big 3 for me‚Ä¶,"Best functionality of the big 3 for a VAT registered Self-Employee (I.e. Quickbooks, Xero, FreeAgent) but a few niggling functionality gaps remain. Great that it can file VAT and Self Assessment returns, but I can't use the latter because it doesn't have the Property section (I can't be the only Self-employed person who also owns a Buy To Let property). And the Expenses functionality is behind competitors. But otherwise I love it. Super support team and online Help."
4,Life made easier,"Life made easierReally enjoy the software, easy to use and the support/helpdesk are amongst the best I've seen - friendly, supportive, understand your business/what your're trying to do and very quick to reply. Linking credit card bill is also a great enhancement.Only 2 asks - a better expense management process to capture photos of receipts at time of purchase and match to bank/credit card feeds when they arrive, rather than waiting, and to improve the flexibility around mileage expense claims for company car drivers (there are some !!) - its not always 45p"

5,I just love how FreeAgent makes my life‚Ä¶,I just love how FreeAgent makes my life easier and puts me at ease financially and legally...
5,Great all round business accounting tool,"Very happy with my choice of FreeAgent for my book keeping and taxation requirements.  For me, as a freelancer, it is a great tool - not can I undertake all the standard book keeping functions, like invoicing, outgoing payments, bank integration etc, it also allows me to add personal expenses directly into the tool and set up client projects that I can record time against.  When I generate an invoice for that project, the tool automatically aggregates any unbilled timesheets and expenses, which saves me loads of time in having to manually calculate sums due.  I've used several accounting solutions over the years, including Sage and Quickfile, and this is by far the best for my business."

Customer support is excellent and they are open to new ideas. it has saved me days of work a year and I regularly recommend FreeAgent to friends and associates.
5,Great,"Great. Enabled me not to pay out on an Accountant and to know exactly how my business is doing including my upcoming tax liabilities.My only criticism is the partner, Yodlee, that they chose to use for integration with my business banking. Yodlee often has problems and I would prefer they used an open banking compliant partner."
4,The customer service is quick,"The customer service is quick, always helpful and I have noticed alot of time saved by using Freeagent.

4,"Great system, no jargon and easy to use","As a small business and sole trader, I'm really happy with FreeAgent. It's simple to use, no jargon, and I can work my way around it quite happily. The support team in the background seem to be very innovative and helpful in ensuring FreeAgent provides what business owners need. The only thing I would ask to improve it is for sole traders to have automatic bank feeds, and for the bank feeds to work all the time. Otherwise, great system."

4,It'd be five stars but for price,"It'd be five stars but for price.  It's a little on the pricey side, but it is reliable, pretty easy to set up and use, has a great mobile app, access to webinars (stupid term!), makes tax returns extremely easy (providing the data is entered as you go) - mine took less than ten minutes from calculation to completed submission.  You can link straight to your bank so you don't need to type all that data in, just confirm it's correct.  Receipts, invoices and so on can be photographed and attached to expenses and payments immediately on the mobile app.The mobile app is much more limited than the desktop programme, so you can't just use your mobile for everything if that's what you want."

5,Easy and a pleasure to use. Superb customer support.,"After months of headache and frustration with other softwares, discovering FreeAgent brought light and peace of mind. It is a joy to work with.

There are some awkward cases where it's not obvious, or actually possible, to do some of the things I'd like to do, which would make it easier to manage some aspects of my business.I've found it *very* reliable, and I *love* that I can download a complete archive of my accounts in a usable format.I'd like to see improvements being rolled out at a quicker pace - that would give me more of a sense that FreeAgent is committed to improving their software and responding to user feedback."

I also don't have to worry about chasing up invoices, as that is done automatically, as well as tracking payments into my account or by Stripe."

5,Ridiculously simple but effective,"Such a simple and effective way to manage your books! As a one man band I do not have the time or energy to figure out complicated systems or invoicing software, Freeagent takes all the hard work out and in a few clicks I have creates an invoice that sends automatically on the date I have selected. Messaging the team with queries or even suggestions is so easy and they are all so freindly."

5,Such an easy and intuitive cloud based accounts platform,I really do not know what i would do without Freeagent. I am a UK based self employed filmmaker and run my own production company which means that most of my time is taken up on the job. Accounts was always something that filled me with dread until I started using this software. It has a really user friendly interface and is clearly designed with people like me. It really does take most of the stress from the mundane responsibilities of book keeping. I in particular love the automation of Tax and PAYE which I think has saved my ¬£¬£¬£s in accounts fees. I know it's not a substitute for a clued up accountant but it really does help small businesses like mine manage essential accounts duties.
5,Freeagent is absolutely a life saver‚Ä¶,"Freeagent is absolutely a life saver for me. It's features such as VAT, payroll and self assessment return makes it a doddle to manage my personal service limited company."

5,i can totally recommend FreeAgent and‚Ä¶,"i can totally recommend FreeAgent and use it for bot my business and my club. the user interface is really intuitive, system easy to understand and integrates nicely with payment systems.I tried a few of the well know accounting options but none came close to freeAgent. It also also a basic project management element so from quote through to project and then to invoicing this system is brilliant"
4,Free Agent Need to look at Quickbooks for guidance,"As self employed/sole traders need access to personal accounts, free agents limits to business accounts and transactions makes it impossible for small businesses to use.Hopefully they can learn from Quickbooks what small businesses/sole traders and self employed people really need."
5,Overall works well,"Overall works well. Needs a way to add interest to overdue invoices. For example, if a client has 30 days to pay, then when they are 31+ days over due each reminder email should add a percentage of interest to the invoice for late payment, or something along those lines. Currently there is no way to do this, so there is no incentive from clients to pay on time. Plus this is a feature that users have been asking for for years, check the forums if you don't believe me.Also need to have a way to set defaults for invoices. I hate having to check all the same boxes etc every time I make an invoice, there should be a place to set the defaults so that it remember I always want settings x,y,z."

4,Very useful software.,"I've been using FreeAgent for over 6 months now. The software does everything I need it to do and a lot more.  It's intuitive enough that I've rarely had to approach customer services for help, but when I did they were very prompt and efficient."
3,All looks good however..,"All looks good however... a few things are missing. Unable to select and print or email multiple documents at the same time. Customer asked us to send him last 11 invoices and 4 quotes. That takes about 30min in Freeagent for an inexperienced person. Recurring invoices are pain unless you always remember the formula like 03 ${month+1} ${year} to 03 ${month+1} ${year+1} for subscriptions. No, we don't remember it. Reconciliation gets things wrong and keeps matching Paypal transactions to the last one Explained already. Mobile app not very intuitive. Should be redesigned with basic tasks on the home page. So much potential."

5,Exemplary customer service team,We have three years of experience with FreeAgent. I would be very reluctant to use anything else. We have tried both Quickbooks Online and Sage Online.

The product is robust and constantly improves -the reports are great and the dashboard very reassuring.  Euro transactions plus Sterling are accommodated with no problem. Helpline readily available and their team do not make you feel stupid if you ask questions.
5,Excellent package,This is the easiest software I have ever used and any small problems I have encountered have been very easily and quickly dealt with by the support team.Starting up a new company no matter how small is daunting but Free Agent have made it very easy.

4,Generally very good,"Generally very good, easy to use, and great support. However i can't give it 5 stars because i do not believe Freeagent are investing enough in further development of the platform and continuous improvement. They have a solid product and they appear to be sticking with it, only making minor updates and improvements. They do not look like they are investigating or making significant improvements to keep pace with the market (e.g. integration with Power BI so we have more flexibility in visualising our data). This makes them good, but not great in my view. We are a growing business and can see ourselves outgrowing Freeagent before long."

Useful, intuitive tools; quick support; reasonable monthly fee. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because some of the workflows are clunkier than I might have hoped for, and some of the finance overview isn‚Äôt particularly clear.

It makes sending invoicing and keeping track of my accounts so much easier!!!!I also love how easy it makes things for me to do my own self-assessment when it comes to tax time.

Has been down or intermittent for months;- the same feed is actually unreliable. when working on the corporate tax i noticed the system didn't import a couple of transactions 3 months back with no reason. i know the same happened with another colleague using FreeAgent;- the bonus paid to get the ""corporation tax"" option doesn't seem good value for money. The system should provide an easy way to compile a micro-entity return;- the content in the community and knowledge base is fairly poor. Again almost no into on how to consolidate accounts for a micro-entity based on the freeagent values. The process should be a lot clearer."

5,One word: Fantastic,"Fantastic, simple to use, and cut my admin time down by over 90%. Everything is so straightforward, I don't have to do anything additional for my accountant to get all my information for quarterly/annual fillings."
3,Freeagent - good but expensive,"Freeagent is a good service, but at over ¬£20 p/m exc VAT it is very expensive software compared with the immense offerings from companies such as Microsoft and Adobe. Very likely I will have to move to an open-source accounting package in the near future."
4,"Reliable, capable and great service","I'm not the best to ask for an opinion because I think, as a micro company, I/we only use a fraction of Freeagent's full capabilities and potential.  That said, it does exactly what we need it to and does so totally reliably and reasonably intuitively.  Customer support is first class."
4,Great programme and like that it is Scottish but couple of glitches....,"I think this is a really helpful, comprehensive programme, I've used it for a number of years.But I just went through 17/18 accounts for tax return and faced some issues. I uploaded my bank statements month by month. But as I started to fill in explanations I realised some entries were missing. So I went back, downloaded all my accounts again and re-uploaded them, about 100 inputs repeated themselves and I had to go through, find them and delete them. Think this is some sort of glitch maybe that it doesn't recognise them as I had renamed them?We also tried to use the phone app to upload receipts, this is a great feature and super fast, but about every 4-5 uploads when you click back to enter a new input it jumps all the way back to your most recent date and you have to scroll back down, if you are updating stuff from a year ago that's alot of scrolling and it stalls and reloads all the way through that. Another glitchy thing maybe.But in general, like I said I like alot of features, particularly the invoicing and be able to uplaod from bank account and assign invoices and receipts easily. Also love that it is a Scottish company and the Help section and advice bits are all really detailed."
5,I will always recommend FreeAgent to anyone!,"FreeAgent is so easy to use, and makes doing the books simple and clear. Our accountant can access it really easily too. I have found their support to be outstanding every single time. I frequently recommend FreeAgent to anyone starting a business and needing accounts software."
5,Great system,"Great system - easy to use, helpful support team if you do have questions and everything in one place."
5,I have been a customer since the start‚Ä¶,"I have been a customer since the start of my business in 2010 and I have made myself a promise never to leave.  Its the easiest most sensible system to use and the support team is exceptional.  I did test a well-known competitor last year just to see if it was as easy as they said.  It was an expensive and costly experiment and FreeAgent is the only product I recommend to my clients, freelancers and anyone who is looking to set up and run there own business.  Its the best around and just keeps getting better."
5,Great piece of web-based software that‚Ä¶,Great piece of web-based software that simplifies your freelance or small business life.
5,A very useful aid to my business,I find this system invaluable. We use it 2/3 times a week to keep our accounts up to-date and track cashflow.
5,I have been using Freeagant for years,"I have been using Freeagant for years, its Excellent. I just wish the rest of the accountancy world was a good as these guys!!"
5,Excellent Accountancy Package - Flexible and Intuitive,Excellent software.  Before selecting FreeAgent I trialled most of the other packages that are available. I found FreeAgent to be the most flexible and intuitive to use.  The support is UK based too which is an absolute joy!
5,Fantastic easy to use system,"Fantastic easy to use system, with excellent support services!"

4,There are some things that I cannot do‚Ä¶,"There are some things that I cannot do on Freeagent, but helpful staff have always provided ""workarounds"". I recommend Freeagent."
5,I love FreeAgent!,"I love FreeAgent - it helps me keep track of all my finances easily, including reminding me of time I haven't billed for yet. I love that I can file my tax return straight from FreeAgent, and it tells me how much tax I owe and when to pay it. My only slight issue is that my bank feed takes a few days to update, but this is an issue with my bank not being supported by FreeAgent. But that's a small thing and all the other features more than outweigh it. Would highly recommend!"
4,FreeAgent is great for sole traders and‚Ä¶,FreeAgent is great for sole traders and small limited companies. I use it for my own business and have set it up for clients as well. I would 100% recommend.

5,hugely helpful for solo creative business owner,"I‚Äôm a solo creative business and was introduced to FreeAgent via a conference. It has been worth every penny of my investment from the word go - I don‚Äôt have complex accounting needs, but even so, just being able to see at a glance how my business is going, what I‚Äôm spending and where and the hours of work it has saved me at year end is of huge value. It‚Äôs so easy and simple I‚Äôve hardly had to reach out for help, but when I have, my problems have been solved immediately, efficiently and with a friendly approach. Brilliant!"
5,FreeAgent are far and away the best‚Ä¶,"FreeAgent are far and away the best on-line accountancy company.Innovative software, efficient operation,  and very user-friendly."
5,essential kit.,essential kit.
4,Great experience but would love more bank feed features.,Great experience. Would love to be able to do more with the bank feed feature. For example on QB you can tag your expenses so you know exactly how much you're spending and where. A basic search of transactions would be good too.
5,FreeAgent changed the way I do business,"I discovered FreeAgent about 7 years ago and it completely changed the way I ran my business.Recurring invoicing along with personalized email reminders allowed me to focus on growth rather than spending my time chasing clients so they would clear their outstanding invoices.Today, I know exactly where I stand with a single click thanks to FreeAgent.Are you still waiting to change the way you run your business?"

5,Definitely recommend,"We've been using this book keeping software for about 3 years now and have never looked back. It's very simple and their support is great - not just technical, but accounting aspects as well. What's more I actually 'enjoy' using it, which is a great help! Has saved me a fortune from using a chartered accountant to do our book keeping."

5,I've used FreeAgent across 4 different‚Ä¶,I've used FreeAgent across 4 different businesses and continue to recommend it to anyone that asks for an accounting software recommendation! The User Experience makes it a pleasure to log in to undertake even the most boring of administrative tasks. They continue to improve areas that need work and I've always been impressed with the speed and level of support that I've received. Keep up the good work!
5,"Freeagent is fast, easy, full-featured, and beautiful","As a software developer and quality manager myself, I have tested 5 different accounting software products for my business. The only one that A) worked fast, B) was friendly and easy to use, C) had a great flat rate (no extra costs!), and D) contained all features I needed, was Freeagent.After my decision, I even stumbled upon an extra great reason to use FreeAgent... E): the support desk is free to use, incredibly kind, fast to respond, and has the knowledge to help you in one go!Oh, and being a Dutch citizen using UK software:F)  invoices, outgoing emails, and reminder mails are all in my own language!"
5,Highly recommend,"I have been using FreeAgent for over a year now and can honestly say I love it. Bookkeeping is not my strength but FreeAgent is incredibly intuitive to use and going to one, joined up place to do all my financial tasks makes the job so much quicker and almost enjoyable! And my accountant is under the false impression that I know what I‚Äôm doing, thanks to FreeAgent keeping everything in such good order! Highly recommend!"
5,Great to use,Very good   its simple to use
5,Thanks FreeAgent,Easy to use and tailor made for our requirements
5,Free agent a great partner for my business.,Free agent have now interduced insights. A very helpful addition to their service. The company never stands still. A massive help to my business.
5,FreeAgent is just fabulous!,"FreeAgent is just fabulous! It saves me days and days each quarter and means that I can focus on my business. What's the best bit? The help line are wonderful and human and empathetic, plus they solve the problems straight away. They are so nice it's almost worth ringing up just for a chat!I've recommended it to other people and they all rave about it too."
3,Easy to Use but Expensive,The software is easy to use but I really dislike their pricing plan.  If you're a lone trader it costs 420 per annum to use the software yet they do steep discounts if you recommend people (not much use if you're not part of a large network of contacts). They do discounts if you use certain accountants but not the one I use so it's hit and miss what you are charged compared to others.  So according to their business plan you have two customers using the same software and being charged wildly different rates which does feel really unfair.(RE: the referral scheme - as mentioned above it's no good if you're not part of a large network of contacts).
5,Excellent accounting software for freelance business,"FreeAgent is excellent, as easy to use as you could hope for, and helps me run the financial side of my business with confidence, and without an accountant.I use it for my one-man business as a contractor and occasional freelancer providing engineering design services. With only one regular client, and few occasional freelance clients, my accounts aren‚Äôt complicated, but it‚Äôs still very much worth the money. As well as maintaining the accounts, it has very useful features like preparing and submitting VAT returns, and preparing all the info you need for tax returns - not only corporation tax, but the individual self-assessment income tax returns for all users too.For my business it does all I could want it to, easy to use and understand. For a different sort of business there may be limitations I can‚Äôt foresee, but it should work well for most small businesses."
5,I run a small web agency and Freeagent‚Ä¶,"I run a small web agency and Freeagent is a godsend. Started off using spreadsheet, then tried Sage (too complicated) and Quickbooks but FreeAgent is by far the easiest to use. The dashboard gives you an instant overview of your business, who owes you cash, tax timeline keeps you on the straight and narrow and their customer help desk are quick to help (same day)... When you sign up there is often a discount code available so have a look - if you use my referral code (42ahvh04) we both receive a 10% subscription discount...."
3,Have been a great advocate of Freeagent‚Ä¶,Have been a great advocate of Freeagent in the past but recent ongoing problems when connecting to my HSBC account are making me rethink my approach. With Open Banking this should no longer be an issue - but it is.  The processes for adding and updating Freeagent were good but the now seem rather clunky and not optimalMy HSBC business account does not support contactless which is really important to me - so I will be reviewing my whole banking and accounting software solutions over the next few months - looking for far better and market leading solutions
5,Simply Excellent !!,Simply Excellent !!
5,Perfect for me,"It's one of those ""Does what it says on the tin"" things.Perfect for me and my Sole Trader business."
3,Bank Feed doesn't work,All good except that we have to manually download the bank feed which is time consuming.  I was under the impression that this would happen automatically but it doesn't for our bank.
4,Freeagent great package with small issues.,Freeagent is a really good package and is only let down with some elements that I would have thought would have been very easily rectified. I think the support is excellent and all in all it is a package I would be relatively happy to recommend .
5,Best in class,"Best in class,  nothing else needs to be said"
5,easy to use and very reliable,easy to use and very reliable
4,Great but needs proper credit card feed integrations,"I love FreeAgent but the lack of properly integrated credit card feeds is a massive shortfall, and one that constantly has me eyeing up Xero as an alternative. I appreciate a third party provision was implemented, but frankly the notion of handing over my login to my Amex account represents the kind of security flaw that is page 1 on the ""things you should never do online"" manual. Ergo, I cannot use it and rely on a manual integration which is still a real pain in the neck."
5,Ten years of good service,"I'm freelancer, I work from home, I charge a hourly rate, I not keen on accountants, I'm happy to do it myself and FreeAgent has let me do this for over ten years. It all just works."
5,great support,great support
5,The best there is.,"The best there is. Been using Freeagent since 2012 for my business accounts. It's simple, yet powerful - makes invoicing and VAT or Tax Returns the work of minutes, keeps track of invoices really easily, and provides clear information on who your best clients are, fastest payers etc. Takes seconds to set up a new client, then seconds to send estimates and invoices.Customer service is astonishingly good. They're super well informed, charming and very quick to respond.Nothing bad to say about them in 7 years."
4,Intuitive and great customer service,Intuitive and great customer service. Just need to make it so I can do away with the need for an accountant completely and it would be five stars.
5,I have joined Freeagent a few months‚Ä¶,"I have joined Freeagent a few months ago and it has literally changed my life. I used to be forever looking for receipts, trying to remember what certain payments were for. Now with the banking feed I can keep track of all this daily. It takes just a few minutes (or less) so I have made a habit of doing this first thing in the morning while I have my breakfast. No more painstakingly searching for receipts or trying to remember what payments were for, as it is all still so fresh in my memory I have every single penny accounted for since I'm using Freeagent. And I love how it remembers spending categories. Repeat payments to staff, suppliers, Freeagent automatically suggests the correct spending category which makes it so much easier to keep track of where the money goes. This also helps me to get a much better understanding of where I could (and should) make savings. The invoicing feature and connection to the bank feed is great too. Easy to keep track on who has or canst paid. Very happy overall."
4,Great app for freelancers,"Great app for freelancers, the easiest way to keep your books organised.Missing a few features if you want your company to grow, though: there's no approval for staff timesheets and expenses and reporting capabilities are limited and cumbersome."
5,Simple to use and very helpful support‚Ä¶,Simple to use and very helpful support from Freeagent.

5,I'm a simpleton when it comes to‚Ä¶,"I'm a simpleton when it comes to numbers, but Freeagent was easy to get my head around and with the excellent on line help and video tutorials i have been able to become pretty nifty at my basic accounts. Excellent accounts tool and well supported."
4,Great but let down by foreign currency bills,"I'd have given 5 stars if only it was possible to enter bills in foreign currencies - this shortcoming is really irritating. I know I'm not the only person this affects, and it's been flagged up for improvement for many years without ever seeming to come to the top of the priorities list. Shame!"
5,Best way to run a small creative business,"Great product, really helps the small business to stay on top of invoicing. Best part is the near-automated tax return. Absolute life-saver!"
5,Smooth transition from semi-manual to‚Ä¶,Smooth transition from semi-manual to fully-digital accounting package. Easy multi-currency options. Now fully MTD ready. Thank you.

5,Excellent piece of software for daily use,"Excellent piece of software which I use on a daily basis and have already recommended to a number of fellow business owners, I would suggest this is saving me hundreds of hours a year simplifiying aspects such as for invoicing, banking transactions and identification of key clients, but more importantly overdue invoices with automatic reminders!"
5,"Excellent, as always","Quick, friendly and useful - what more could you ask for..."
5,Great product and service.,Great product and service.
5,Instrumental in my business growth.,"Only open things on my wishlist are for bills in foreign currency, and some more granularity about user roles (e.g. make it so some people can see bills but not invoices, and some can see invoices but not bills etc.).  Those minor gripes aside, freeagent has been fundamental in giving me full visibility of every penny as I have grown my business from ¬£50k per year to ¬£1.2 million a year.  It's saved me a fortune in finance costs and people if I'd have used a more old school accounting approach."

5,Free your time with FreeAgent!,"An excellent accounting system. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fool proof, but I am clearly a fool as I did make some posting errors, but they are easily corrected. We manage our online VAT and Payroll with FreeAgent and our Tax Returns are easily done. Online guides are excellent and so is email and telephone support."
5,"Far more user friendly than Xero, Quickbooks, Sage etc.","I tried out Xero, QuickBooks and Sage and to be honest, FreeAgent is vastly more user-friendly than the rest.In one morning I was able to import all my bank statements and get everything up and running. The system really is very easy to use and more than pays for itself with better control of your cashflow and easier billing.I highly recommend giving it a try."

4,Exceptional for Freelancers / Contractors,"So, and without wanting to sound conceited, as a Chartered Management Accountant who specialises in the implementation of Financial Systems (albeit for larger companies) - and as someone who has previously used other systems (e.g. Sage, Quickbooks, Mamut, and, latterly Xero) to do my own books, I'd like to think I am well qualified to review FreeAgent... so, here goes ...It's good. Seriously good, in fact.Simple to set up (I migrated from Xero and was fully configured in under an hour) the application is quick and to intuitive to use. The online help is very good, and the support desk is frankly exceptional.There are also a decent and growing number of integrations with other cloud applications.Obviously, it is not going to suit all businesses, given the perfectly reasonable limitations on functionality (say, e.g. inventory management), so, if your business has complex back-office processes, you might want to look elsewhere... but for the needs of a simple business, it should tick the boxes easily.For a freelancer or contractor, it is nothing short of perfect. Totally perfect.It does payroll, projects (incl. time recording), basic multicurrency and other cool stuff 'out-of-the-box'. For equivalent functionality, I was paying Xero over ¬£45 per month.Oh, and it's a UK success story. What's not to love.I felt compelled to leave a review, only as I had read some of the (small number) of negative comments on here with some bemusement. Some of those guys clearly don't 'get it' and just need to seek the services of an accountant."
5,The system is really good & easy to use,"The system is really good and easy to use, my only suggestion for improvement would be to automatically link bank statements to the expenses that have been recorded."
5,Nice self accountant,"Thanks, much easy with you, I can manage my money from my phone, at the beginning I thought about a new computer for my ltd, then I saw how easy is to work from the phone, already economised 500 ¬£"
5,"Fine for small businesses, useless for bookkeepers/accountants","No bank rec function. You cannot post to suspense from the bank. You cannot journal to the bank. You cannot input a receipt or sales invoice after a vat period has closed. You can only totally lock a period, not password protect or only allow a bookkeeper/accountant to amend, so the client can go in change things. No audit trail making it impossible to know what your client has done. I could go on!Great for small, simple businesses but QuickBooks Online is a million times better & half the price!"
2,Happy to recommend this company,"Happy to recommend this company. They have a paid accountancy as a service software product which happens to be free if you are an RBS customer.They do not offer accountancy advice or filing or preparation of accounts however you have a large choice of freeagent compatible accountants for this so you can shop around and take your pick. This is potentially much better than an all in 1 bundled service because you have choice. The email support is exemplary, friendly and helpful and they think like a software development company (which they are) and give hints about upcoming releases and work in progress. The software is simple and easy to use and the bank integration works flawlessly. What's not to like?"
3,Poor set,"Poor setup especially if your business isn't just starting up, poor software, terrible nonexistent phone support. Recommended by Natwest should of known what the outcome would be."
3,Is what you expect from the price‚Ä¶not really,Is what you expect from the price however there are flaws in the process especially vat and the help centre doesn‚Äôt match what the screen shows.  Bank feeds are very often super slow or down.Will move to another supplier at years end.
5,I definately do not agree with this‚Ä¶,"I definately do not agree with this review with respect to support. Provided that all you need is something simple then probably you will be happy with the level of support. However, I recently got locked out of my account, it has been 2 days now and I am still locked out of my account. I have had no update on when I can expect the issue to be resolved, other than a vague promise that I am in a queue, although no means apparently of identifying when my issue will come to the top of the queue and get dealt with. I am told the issue is not a support issue, it is a technical support issue! Support apparently have no insight in to a call once it has been forwarded to technical support and there is no access to technical support. No access to any complaints department, and no speaking to a manager. When I get access to my account I intend to do an export of my data and close my account and open an account with a company which is more customer orientated."
5,Freeagent isn't perfect,"Freeagent isn't perfect - but it's good if you're either new to bookkeeping and self-assessment filing or if you just want to make life easier. Whilst there are some flaws of Freeagent, it is a really easy and completely cloud-based system to keep the taxman happy!But unfortunately, that is really all it is good for. It has been very frequent for me that Freeagent's transaction detection is missing out a few transactions which has caused the balance of my banks and PayPal to show different figures to the ones Freeagent have detected. This has left me having to either add them myself, or riskily leave them, which kind of defeats the purpose of an automated bookkeeping service that is supposedly meant to be easier (especially when paying the recurring price that Freeagent sell their service for!)Their self-explanation feature is also hit-and-miss. It never seems to automatically explain a sale as a sale (weird, right?) no matter how many times I have explained previously similar transactions as a sale. As for outgoings or transferring funds from one account to another, I usually always have to explain these apart from a view that set a 'semi-explanation' which require human intervention before proceeding. The automation side of Freeagent needs to be heavily fixed.The price is also very high for what you receive, although this is to be expected as currently at the time of writing this review there is not any other reliable provider that files your tax return for you. But another positive is that their support is pretty good - they claim their accountants are not allowed to assist you with your bookkeeping explanations however some of them have slyly 'hinted' towards me what explanations 'could' be correct ;-)I have good faith that Freeagent will eventually develop to be more advanced and offer more features, but as of yet it is remaining a 3-star until they improve the services and features they have to offer."
5,High quality accounting software with unparalleled ease,"Imagine my surprise when I realised I'd been ""testing"" FreeAgent for 3 years... I actually love it, which I appreciate makes me sound very dull.Here's some reasons I've enjoyed running the financial duties of my business in that time. I hope you might find it useful or reassuring if you're considering FreeAgent for your business accounting:Ease of set-upComplete flexibilityIntegrates with my banking transactions automatically (Barclays)Automated explanations, and complete the rest on my iPhone app - on train, in bed etc.Superb reports fit for any accountant, better than many accountants' reports in factInvoices look amazing and can be personalised, and the automatic chasing / thanking clients for payment is a delight to useDirector/Owners' self assessments completed in a doddle - and for free as part of our subscriptionI had a think about the downsides to be thorough as I started this write up.In truth, I haven't found a fault yet - Roan the data guru there introduces great new reports and app features quite often, none of which have ever crossed my mind as being missing, but always greatly appreciated updates - latest I've just had an email about last week is the new customer sales report.Pricing is fair (not the cheapest), however you do absolutely get what you pay for, the business is UK based with excellent customer support. And there are 2 ways to reduce the cost, potentially to the point of being free:1. pay annually to get 12 months for the price of 10 (as I recall that was the deal. I only spotted that within my billing options last year.2. PLUS referring other great users can earn you, and the referred new customer, a 10% discount on the subscription fee for life! One day I hope they will be paying me, but that's a way off...Our 10% discount code is   44b11yog   and if you found this review helpful, I'd love you to use or share our code. We'll benefit as well as you, and for that you'll have our eternal gratitude.Referral Code: 44b11yogThank you."
5,A vital business tool,"A vital business tool. I've been using Freeagent since its beta days, and although the speed of improvements and features in the last few years has been slower than expected; it's a great company to do business with -- and compares favourably to Xero and Quickbooks. Highly recommended for all small and medium businesses!"
5,Simple book keeping system but it's ‚Ä¶,"Simple book keeping system but it's powerful enough to be used for 1000s of invoices every year. Prompt and knowledgeable customer service too.Invoice template designer is my favourite feature, our invoices look professional and they have automated reminders too.I have used their competition too but free agent is just perfect for a company our size."
4,"Fantastic product, fantastic support",its one of those products that when you start using it you ask yourself 'why the hell wasnt i doing this before'. It's shaved around 2 days per month off my workflow and is a total joy to use.
5,My favourite business tool!,"I started my own company at age 22 and felt completely overwhelmed with everything business, until I tried Freeagent. My accountant recommended it along with a few other products, but Freeagent was my favourite. It's been 3 years, and I'm still going strong. Use daily for invoices, time tracking, etc. Solid product, new features added all the time, Can't recommend enough!"
5,Tap Into IT Where You Are Ltd,An excellent speedy advice and repair service where ever you are on all computer problems. Very knowledgeable and most helpful.
5,Simply Superb,Can't fault FreeAgent. With their software I finally feel like I understand what's going on in my company. Leaps and bounds ahead of the spreadsheet my old accountants used!
5,I run a tourism business and this ‚Ä¶total godsend and very clear,"I run a tourism business and this cloud-based system is a godsend.  It links to my barclays business account perfectly - and has done for the past few years.  I've learned lots from their tutorial section.  Staff helpful on phone too - patiently explaining how to split explanations in accounting.  Looking forward instead of fearing VAT registration now.  Plus my accountant is great with it - now he's freed up to give me detailed advice that he'd probably not bother to explain otherwise.  And you can add expenses easily so you never miss anything.  You can photograph receipts and upload.  Seriously, why would you do anything else?"
