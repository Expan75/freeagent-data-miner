It could improve the way it works by taking the Accountancy help &amp; introduce that into the tool in a step by step process within the application. The chatbot article suggestions help 85% of the time, the 15% needs some work. It is value for money for the first two to three years but as your business grows you begin to realise you need an accountant and that&#039;s why the intro of co-pilot is interesting.",2019-10-03 11:05:24

4,"Handy, intuitive app to keep track of income and expenditure. Would be good to shortcut the contacts / projects lists to favourites so not having to scroll through every time.

5,"I&#039;m really surprised. I always relied on an accountant, but since our accountant and tax layer went bankrupt and left me high and dry I decided to take the matter in my own hands. This is the best decision I made so far. The effort I put in matches the effort I had to prepare and discuss paperwork with the accountant. And he pocketed some 2,500 - 3,000 a year. Go figure. This software is awesome!",2019-08-02 12:56:10
5,"The straight forward nature of this programme is superb. Helps me complete complex tasks easily. Great layout (apart from the fluffy animal pictures).

Signed up for a year, but I’m unsure if I’ll sign up next year QB allows me to simply forward my email receipts to an email address in seconds and they’re auto linked to the relevant bank transaction. Also, as a window cleaner I have loads of standing orders and QB allows you to set up a ‘rule’, meaning every time the same transaction appears it’s auto categorised. Lastly, the auto bank feed on QB is instant, whereas FA seems to be lagging by a week or more unless I download a statement Given that QB was only costing me £2.99 a month, I’d really expected an expensive program such as this to have these simple features that make life much quicker &amp; easier",2019-07-08 10:10:50

1," i have given this another shot for a few weeks now, and while i can see how to get to where I need to be, it takes a large number of keys presses and clicking here and there just do simple things. I can get a cash in hand figure in seconds using a spreadsheet, using freeagent takes ten minutes. first I needed to set up an account called &#039;cash in hand&#039; for entering my till sales. Again this just smacks of accountant thinking rather user thinking - everything has to have a category and /or an account! ok , so to enter sales, click on &#039; banking&#039; at top, click on account &#039;cash in hand&#039;, zoom across screen to &#039;more&#039; and click on that (where the add transaction is hiding just above delete account bizarrely), click on add transaction,select a type (sales is way down this list), make sure date is set to what you want because it always defaults to today,enter till sales in amount box, enter a description &#039;till&#039;, finally click one of the create buttons. I make that six clicks and a lot of fiddling around the screen to get to the bits you need. Spreadsheet method: click cell , enter sales, done. Can you see which is easier? A similar pattern of events occurs when trying to enter invoices from suppliers. Oh and don&#039;t forget some till sales are by debit cards which seem to need yet another transaction... There does not seem to be be a way of entering invoice number with &#039;add transaction&#039;, only on the long winded method of creating an invoice. Neither method allows for a local reference number and invoice number to be added that i can see. As it stands, this program is a hundred steps behind what our simple spreadsheet can do for us, and the time it takes to enter less information over multiple screens is frankly archaic. Is it based on some account program from about 20 years ago?! I still feel that this program has been written by accountants and not business people. What we really need is a system whereby we can enter ALL the days activities on ONE screen. The system should be intelligent enough to select the categories accountants want by itself not force us businesses to do the work manually. Even export data is limited to a Microsoft format, what about csv so we can at least load it up properly in libreoffice. I do believe there is a program out there somewhere built for small businesses like ourselves. Freeagent unfortunately is not it at the moment. It is pretty much the same as the big guns like Sage, and although &#039;free&#039; through RBS, I do also have concerns that if your contract with RBS was to end, then we would have to pay just to see and use already entered data. Having used Sage and others on test in the past, they basically turn into ransomware if you refuse to pay. Sorry if this seems all negative, but I hope you find some of it constructive criticism.",2019-05-11 22:07:38
5,"Brilliant platform, works really well for me as I can log my hours and convert them straight into invoices for clients. Easy to find things on it too.

Time tracker is one of the most important, the ability to pull transactions directly in from my bank account is another. Easy to use, intuitive and a clean uncluttered interface. It works how I work, capable of monitoring numerous projects on the go at once (I do web design, graphic design and copywriting). Obviously a lot of thought has gone into the presentation and behind-the-scenes coding. Good job!",2019-04-16 09:00:20

There is a large gap of white paper on the invoice and some of the important information such as company details, vat no and company registration are in different places so looks messy.

5,"I have found the Free Agent software reasonably easy to use. The most challenging aspect is not the software but understanding the accounting setup as undertaking this for a business mid accounting year, to ensure the VAT and Tax liabilities that it generates are a reflection of the actual.

4,Excellent system and easy to use but does not cater for businesses selling goods on the invoicing side. A basic function that QuickBooks and Xero have to convert an Invoice to a Delivery Note does not exist and all my DNs have to be done on Excel outside FreeAgent. It seems others have requested DNs for at least eight years and yet we are being told it is not a priority. How difficult is it to add this feature?,2019-02-26 08:54:47

My letterhead is on a PDF your software insisted I delete pdf and use other formats, this would render most of the documents I receive from others as invalid..USELESS Tutorials are hopelessly fast and not very clear, surely some written notes would help than some random voice who assumes you know it as well as him, examples shown were half done with no clear steps shown",2019-02-06 09:44:34

5,"So far so good, loving the ease of the app",2019-01-26 21:03:51
4,"Excellent software that beats the pants of Quickbooks self employed. There is always room for improvement and there is one thing I prefer on QB. But the difference is that Quickbooks are NOT listening to what their customers want, whereas Freeagent does actually seem to give a damn! Support alone is the one area where Freeagent makes Quickbooks look like amateur hour. The software does more, is easier to use and if you get into difficulties-their support team cares more than the useless QB support. Forget the QB slick adverts. They just want your money then forget you.",2019-01-22 14:22:02
5,"Excellent helpdesk support, very prompt reply and very polite, speedy and helpful response. Followed up very quickly too.",2019-01-16 16:38:29
3,"The programme is easy to use and understand and well laid out The major problem I have is if you need to enter different VAT rates on the same sales invoice, you need to enter two invoices for each VAT rate. The same occurs with bills received. Reverse charge for VAT for service bills from outside EU/UK is not catered for and they have to be entered as EU services to ensure that the VAT is accounted for correctly. If these issues are addressed it would be the best package for my service company.",2019-01-16 08:58:56
5,"Brilliant system, used by our company from day one and we&#039;re now heading into our fifth year of trading. It is easy to use and great for small businesses.

5,It works well.. helps us manage the business..,2018-12-29 11:33:41
2,Disappointed with the bank feed - it doesn&#039;t bring through the HSBC automatically which is time consuming and annoying to activate every week. ,2018-12-26 16:41:41
3,"Huge Negative which sways my total score - Won’t link to my hsbc business account so it’s awful at moment as I have to load my bank transactions manually. One day this will work no doubt but it’s miserable at the moment Positive - repeat invoices take seconds once setup - fab! You can record your time on the work, which is brilliant as you don’t need another time recording system But why do no accounts systems allow you to monitor and predict cash flow unless it’s a looming invoice or a repeat invoice",2018-12-19 09:44:28
1,Poor customer service with no experience of how to resolve the problem. Cannot reset password even after 3 tries and there is no help available regarding that and customer service has no idea about that. Email sent but it take ages to get a reply and apart from that there is no concept of reminder so you can easily miss Payroll and VAT. Self Assessment take ages to update and really require improvement if they want to be competitive. ,2018-12-07 10:05:24

It has its flaws, and there are a few features we&#039;d like to have incorporated at the next release, but in general its been a very easy transition from our previous accounts and database software, and we&#039;ve got up to speed exceedingly quickly. Thank you.",2018-11-22 14:01:32

5,Amazing software that just works! The setup and support is second to none. Having such great support makes me realise I’ve chosen the right accounting software - it does everything easily and quickly and if I get stuck the systems to support me are outstanding. ,2018-10-30 18:45:22
5,Superb. Let’s you always know where you stand re taxes and general finances!,2018-10-28 19:42:43
4,"Brilliant piece of software for all kinds of businesses (corporate, freelance). Monthly price is affordable, and well worth paying for the features you get access to. Looking forward to the future of FreeAgent",2018-10-26 08:35:55
5,"I&#039;m a small retailer, and picked up on FreeAgent only because NatWest offered it for free. Wow, was I lucky! Although it is not really built for retail (none of these things are) the solutions to problems I&#039;d had with other software were really quite obvious, the support was first class and I was up and running live, with six months history loaded up, in only eight days. While working full time, plus while concurrently trialling other software, plus while actually having a life. That contrasts *very* sharply with the trial I had until then been running with some geezers called Q***k**ks for about three months and with no end in sight. To be fair, I haven&#039;t always agreed with the advice offered by your support, and have sometimes done my own contrary thing. But the end result is a system that works for me and puts all the numbers in the right places. And it is all much easier than I had ever thought possible. Since then, it&#039;s taken a bit of time to tweak my regular routines to fit with Freeagent, to work out where and how to best check for errors, and I&#039;ve fallen back on using the API to deal with my six years of sales history (which I recognise isn&#039;t for everybody, but is really easy to use - happy to share code if it is of any use). But, yeah, it is more fun than any accounting system deserves to be, and definitely more fast, fun and useful than the Q***k***k* thing.. Top marks. Even topper marks if you can find a decent way of putting in historical fixed assets, which is the only bugbear I got left. Oh, and multiline bills - I only get one a month, but it irritates me!",2018-10-17 20:10:05
5,"Very intuitive software, that makes accounting fairly easy. The automatic bank feed is a great feature. Customer service is very friendly and helpful.",2018-10-16 16:47:14
3,Response helped me resolve my query but it wast the &quot;clever&quot; solution I had hoped for. More of a manual edit. ,2018-10-11 17:59:27
3,Freeagent meets our company needs at a price that works for us.,2018-10-08 05:57:50
5,"I am the treasurer of a couple of charities, one being a small choir. We use Free Agent for managing the finances of both charities and I find it clear, easy to use and versatile. I sometimes have to adapt something that is there for a business and change it slightly to accomodate our needs (monthly subscriptions, expenses for concerts we are putting on, and lots of cash instead of cheques and bank transactions) but i can usually find a way to adapt it and the support team are always very helpful indeed.",2018-09-08 15:39:44
4,"I like FreeAgent a lot. It&#039;s easy to use and most functionality is designed for a business owner rather that an accountant. The only weaknesses are i) in some of the basic &#039;error correcting&#039; functions that some alternatives provide - for example an &#039;Undo&#039; and an Audit Trail, and ii) in some more mature functions like expenses sheets. They are developing Year End reporting for HMRC and CoHse which will be a big advantage. Customer support is generally excellent. They could do with creating a few more &#039;manuals&#039; to consolidate all the information on the website.",2018-09-08 13:26:21
2,"When I started using FreeAgent I found it really great and useful, until it came time to file my taxes, then I discovered the limitations of FreeAgent. Not only was I unable to manage that from the website, but the categories they had used didn&#039;t match to the categories I was asked to fill in on the Government online tool, which made the process much longer and more painful than it needed to be. Additionally when I need to close payroll this was yet again a feature they did not support. So I am afraid it hasn&#039;t lived up to my expectations and I&#039;ll be looking for a different tool for the future.",2018-09-06 10:09:04
5,"I have spent literally years trying to find the right accounting app for me, as a freelancer. At this point, I&#039;ve used about all of them. I tried QB Freelancer in it&#039;s first year and it had far too many bugs. I used Harvest but it didn&#039;t have all the features I needed. I tried Freshbooks but it just didn&#039;t work and it lacked features. These other platforms all want to just be an expensive cog with a million addons or are just too case-specific or just plain buggy. Frustrated to the point of just using good ol&#039; excel sheets, I found FreeAgent. These guys do just about everything perfectly. It honestly is hard to express that. They had a slightly older UI when I started, but they&#039;re already working on a new one (I&#039;m in the Beta, and it&#039;s awesome). I have my invoicing, time tracking, expense tracking, and all the important stuff right in front of me. I have the usual big-options for getting paid, paypal &amp; stripe, plus banking details for check-payment on the invoice. It will automatically match bank transactions to payments where possible. You can link 1 huge payment to multiple separate invoices (and it keeps track to make sure you don&#039;t get underpaid). There is multi-user support, so I can have employees/contractors work within my business to track their working hours and manage invoicing smoothly and efficiently. I can rebill expenses, with markup to clients. There&#039;s reports, which I use all the time to get a quick glance at what the next round of invoices should look like. I can get account statuses/summaries for any delinquent clients, and it is just amazing. No other platform I&#039;ve worked with had all of these features. None of them were this affordable. And none of them were working this hard on improving their product.",2018-08-22 15:04:20
5,"I felt heard. The first person I spoke to found the specialist to solve my problem but also stayed in touch. So I didn&#039;t feel as if I was being passed around. It was a seemless, simple &amp; pleasant experience!",2018-08-16 14:01:54
5,"FreeAgent has really helped me keep track of everything. However, I would love to be able to do the following: - Upload multiple files simultaneously when attaching files to Invoices. - Ability to delete files automatically in single-use scenarios (Receipts for Invoice etc.) - Connect Expenses to my Bank Accounts - Ability to connect Expenses stated on an Invoice to my Expenses in general",2018-08-16 11:59:47

4,"Great app, bit slow with feature releases",2018-07-23 09:25:52
4,"Very good system, easy to use. But limited in the current globalized world. Two examples: - You dont allow multicurrency bills, but most of our trading in international not only for clients but for providers, freelancers etc. most of them don&#039;t bill in pounds, which creates a lot of hurdles to add their bills. - Related to that, we have revolut multi-currency accounts. While their integration is super good, I cannot pay an euro bill with my euro account and settle automatically, as you don&#039;t allow it as the bill is not in euros. ",2018-07-19 08:45:25
3,"It works well, but updating or changing information on the Freeagent App is very limited...you can&#039;t even click when an Invoice has been paid... it could do with lots more basic editing features.. The biggest thing that annoys me is the 3rd Party bank feed link, which always seems to have issues and I loose accounting data periods that then have to be manually input! I&#039;m an HSBC customer....",2018-07-16 13:14:48
3,"The best thing about Freeagent is the tax return and the simple interface. The integrations and API could be a lot better to allow more automation with other apps and processes - opening this up for many more triggers and actions for tools such as Zapier would massively increase my satisfaction with the product. Also on the app, specific functionality and improvement to the UI when sending invoices would help as I am never sure if when I send an invoice in the future has sent or scheduled. I&#039;d really like to be able to link expenses and hours to invoices on the app. I&#039;d also like a better way of linking photos of receipt items that take sometimes up to 5 days to show on the bank statement Being able to forward invoices to Freeagent to be scheduled to pay would be really helpful. I&#039;d love to have more insight in projects and see how they are performing at a top level. ",2018-07-16 11:46:42
5,Makes day to day bookkeeping jobs easy. Could do with a delivery note function though which would make it 10 stars.,2018-07-16 09:21:31
5,"It just works and makes sense. The UI is a pleasure to work with and if there is something that you need advice on, support is very responsive and thoughtful. This is the 3rd business I am using FreeAgent on and everyone business partner I introduce is also seeing how FreeAgent can make their life a lot easier, especially when it comes to estimate, Project tracking, reconciling bank accounts and running payroll.

Consequently I learned quickly and have loved the layout ever since. Plenty of pictures and colour - I tell everyone about it because it makes accounting fun. My accountant for a ltd company just gave me all my files back when she saw what I could do. And the ability to photograph receipts and log them using my phone is just dinky - makes me want to do it.",2018-06-21 19:29:48

3,"Automated emails is a nice feature, although customising when they are sent is not possible it still makes life that little bit easier.

Will likely to move to sage as colleague has used them and said the support really could guide them. For example you know you want to put value x in box 6 of the VAT return. You talk to your accountant they say just put x in the box, but freeagent (FA) is not showing that value as you are doing a correction and neither the accountant nor FA support is able to help. FA Support says we cannot tell you ask an accountant, the accountant says I have no idea how to do that in FA and we are using an accountant that is a partner with FA. ",2018-06-13 08:54:12

I&#039;ve only dealt with support once when I first started as I was adding in a lot of previous information and the support was excellent. They suggested a different way of adding the info that just made it so much easier. I&#039;m really happy with FreeAgent and wish I had started using it much earlier.,2018-06-13 08:47:14
5,"Love your service! However could you please at the metric of being able to track the profitability per hour of each project. You already have the invoice totals and the hours tracked.

After contacting support, Gary Shand gave me a list of operations to perform and this put all my problems with the account right. Many Thanks Gary. Regards Nigel Harrison",2018-03-06 19:22:42

1,"I am an accountant for a client who uses FreeAgent. I am unbelievably appalled that I cannot add new balance sheet accounts or accounts with a numbers greater than 399 (I think it was). Additionally the nomenclature is peculiar. Categories for the word accounts. for instance. What &#039;s wrong with the word account. Navigating around the site I have found/find that nothing is very obvious/clear.. Although I know they have very many clients I would absolutely NEVER EVER recommend this programme to anyone. I know that sounds harsh but you stated that you want to know how I feel, so I&#039;ve told you. Additionally the lack of telephone support is, in my view, inexcusable. Some of us out here like to actually speak to a person rather than endless emails. Emails are so impersonal. I am tempted to say &quot;I hope this helps&quot; but I fear it will just be dismissed. Such is life. Please feel free to telephone me on 01785 819677.",2018-03-01 16:47:28
5,"Great service, extremely helpful 🤗",2018-01-30 18:47:25
5,"Having spent a number of years contracting and doing my books with accountants using manual systems, I am very impressed by how much easier FreeAgent is to use, and now have no problem keeping all my books regularly up to date. Very impressive.",2018-01-29 19:14:41
2,"Been using for 1 year, at it&#039;s core it works and provides a nice alternative to keeping your data in a spreadsheet and the online integration with self assessment is nice; but there are 3 huge flaws I am struggling to get over and looking to alternatives. 1) No ability to download or export your invoices OR expenses. This is criminal, it&#039;s sensible to have an offline copy of these vital documents (even FreeAgent agrees) but there is no way to do this. All the invoicing &amp; cloud accounting packages I have tested have this basic ability but FreeAgent is the only one who can&#039;t (and won&#039;t) add this feature despite it being requested on the support forums since 2012 *see note 3. 2) Design. The branding and the invoicing are not very nice. Send a client an invoice with online payment and you get a massive &quot;JOIN FREEAGENT&quot; logo plastered all over it, which is a bit unprofessional and I have had raised eyebrows. Worse still, many things have their mascot - a cartoon cat in a suit and tie - everywhere. 3) Feels like development stopped 5 years ago. If you read the support forums there are many basic features people have asked for and it&#039;s apparent that people have been asking for the same things since 2012 and nothing ever seem to get done. On the positive side: 1) Easy to use, the app works well for creating expenses on the fly 2) Integrates with Stripe / Paypal / Bank&#039;s well 3) Provides a few more tools than invoicing services like FreshBooks 4) Very good customer support. 5) UK based, so better geared for UK tax system.",2018-01-29 14:32:09
5,Just does what it needs to do,2018-01-29 11:03:30
5,"To start with, the software is clear and straight forward. Of course, there is a learning curve as with any new programme but it went smoothly for me. Secondly, the staff at FreeAgent are excellent, wether it&#039;s the receptionist on the end of the phone or an advisor - they are friendly, polite and really know their stuff. I&#039;m in my fifth month and have spoken to several advisors multiple times to the point where some of them now know me (!) and they always guide me to a solution and are endlessly patient with my idiotic questions! They are busy people and occasionally the receptionist will arrange for an advisor to call back but it&#039;s always very prompt and they make themselves available as soon as possible.",2018-01-25 11:29:50
5,"FreeAgent is marvellous and I REALLY regret not going though with signing up last year -- or the year before -- OR the year before that! I&#039;ve trialled it and a couple of other similar services over the past few years, always right around the time I do my self-assessment tax return. Then, every year, right after I&#039;ve filed my return at the eleventh hour using calculations I&#039;ve made during an all-day-and-nighter with a spreadsheet, I&#039;ve gone back to doing nothing. After evaluating (again!) the same three services this year, I&#039;ve taken the plunge with FreeAgent and I&#039;m already almost ready for April! Not only that, I&#039;ve discovered that I&#039;ve almost certainly overpaid my taxes in previous years, due to horribly incomplete accounting of my outgoings. Never again, thanks to FreeAgent. Best business decision I&#039;ve made in years!",2018-01-24 17:23:20
5,The software is very functional and user friendly The help section is very well done and found the answer to my questions quickly,2017-12-10 18:10:38
5,"FreeAgent is the right mix of user friendly and sophisticated. We are hugely impressed. We have been using it for three years now, and have used both the UK and the Global versions. The UK one has more functions, but even the Global one is perfectly adequate for a small – but global and data driven – business.",2017-12-08 21:16:37
5,"We looked at pretty much all the online accounting packages before choosing FreeAgent...and I am really glad we did. The software just works - I run a company providing voiceover services worldwide (piersgibbon.com). Most importantly FreeAgent have real accountants on the end of the helpline to sort out your issues. I have gone from paying a bookkeeper every painful VAT quarter...to doing it all myself. Excellent product, excellent company.",2017-12-07 16:07:55
5,It is easy to use. ,2017-12-05 10:31:16

For anyone who asks my advice about what they need to do when starting a small business, my first response is to use FreeAgent!",2017-11-17 13:10:22
3,I would like the webinars to be longer. Not enough on banking and reconciling the bank,2017-11-16 09:08:44
5,"FreeAgent is a good program to work with, but has some failings.I think FreeAgent is very good on helpline, and always try to achieve a resolution to the issue. I think the program could be great with some minor improvements that the company are aware of but don’t seem to be in great hurry to implement.",2017-11-15 16:48:44

4,"Free Agent has made my business run so much more efficient. It also means I no longer have to save shoe boxes for my reciets! Love how it manages invoices and scans you’re bank account and updates. One down side to Free Agent is the customer care. 9/10 times when I ring for support, I get put through to reception and get promised call backs. Most times they call back in the same day, once or twice they haven’t. The annoying this that they’ve called me back later in the day when I haven’t been sat at my computer. They need more staff.

5,As an Accountant FreeAgent is easy to use for both us and our clients. The Support is superb and there is little that can&#039;t be sorted out. ,2017-10-23 11:27:46
5,I&#039;m new to FreeAgent but so far everything is good and the support has been exceptional. I would definitely recommend FreeAgent.,2017-10-20 14:12:19
4,"Great for service oriented sole trader/small business. Its great for… Tracking projects &amp; project profitability. Invoicing is really neat and well implemented. Banking has live bank feeds keeping things always up to date. No reconciliation as such, just “explain” transactions I.e. assign to expense category and job etc as they appear . VAT, Corporation tax and self assessment fully implemented and linked to government gateway account. Very easy tracking of out of pocket expenses &amp; mileage. Uploading expense receipts on the move via smart phone app and camera. No more paper receipts! Attach PDFs to expenses. Upload business documents. Store insurance certificates, Public Liability, VAT certificate etc. Multi currency. RTI payroll upload to HMRC. Useful dashboard showing unpaid invoices, cashflow and a quick P&amp;L balance sheet position. Support from FreeAgent is quick and mostly very helpful. Terrible for… Producing reports beyond clunky P&amp;L, Balance sheet &amp; Trial Balance. No expense reports, sales report, customer sales, user customisable report or data query. No business analysis tools. User data input can be confusing as FreeAgent pre-fills most form fields with last entered Data (presumably they think this is helpful for users entering repetitive data). Can lead to clumsy and inaccurate data entry if your jobs, invoices and expenses aren’t all repetitions. (Wish they’d just leave it all blank). ",2017-10-04 14:43:43

5,"First off FreeAgent is a brilliant tool. What makes it really stand out, though, is the support. Personable, knowledgeable, human support to help with complicated accounting questions at such quick response times is what makes FreeAgent so much more than just a web app. I can&#039;t speak highly enough of the experience I&#039;ve had using FreeAgent. I would recommend it to anyone looking to manage their own business finances.",2017-07-12 09:43:32

5,"I love FreeAgent. Subscribing was one of the best decisions we made at the start of the business - and it has improved immensely over the last six years. Good graphical design for visual thinkers, intuitive layouts, simple definitions that real people can understand. We love knowing how the business finances look in real time.

4,I&#039;ve used Freeagent for a few years now and love it. It has saved me a lot of admin time and enables me to easily track my time and expenses and produce professional esimayes and invoices with minimal effort.

It&#039;s links with my bank account and go cardless save me time and effort and significantly improve my cash flow. The support from the team is first class. They are responsive, highly knowledgeable and when an issue needs escalating to technical, the support team maintain control of the issue and provide regular feedback until the issue is resolved. I am dealing with real people who have been with the business a long time and therefore although I am sure I am one of many, I feel that I have a good relationship with the helpdesk staff. Whether by email or phone, they are always willing and able to help. There is always room for improvement, and my only request would be improved reporting functionality, but then I am being picky in order to provide balance. Would and do recommend to family and friends, colleagues and clients.",2017-05-02 21:16:24
3,FreeAgent is easy to use but I need it to provide cash basis accounting and make it easier to work with my bank account to be great,2017-05-02 08:10:49
5,"Super responsive support team - very useful software which let&#039;s me keep on top of my business finances and feel like I have everything in control. Tax timeline is great.

4,Automates and consolidates a lot of accouting chores. Has a few flaws in terms of integration between functionality. Example being Expenses against actual account in the ledger. Still highly recommend.,2017-04-29 09:00:42
5,"Functionality is obviously the main driver to happiness with a service. FreeAgent has that in spades. The only area I find deficient is the minutes and certificates for dividends - it&#039;s functional but not great. Everything else is perfect: VAT, invoicing, bills and expenses, bank reconciliation, and reporting. But the icing on the cake is the excellent support. I&#039;ve made a couple of data entry errors, and thought I&#039;d drop a note to FreeAgent support line, not really expecting a response. This was at 18:30 in the evening, yet I received a response within 15 minutes with an explanation of how to resolve my problem. Fantastic!",2017-04-28 14:17:37

5,"I&#039;m very new to running my own business and used FreeAgent after it was recommended (by several people). It has made running the accounting side of things a breeze. I&#039;ve used it to invoice people, connect to my bank account, and I&#039;ve also used the time tracking function for certain projects. I&#039;ve set it up to do my first self-assessment, and even though I haven&#039;t done it yet, I&#039;m sure it will be very straight forward thanks to how easy FreeAgent is to use. Using FreeAgent means I don&#039;t have to worry about that side of things and can concentrate on doing some actual work.",2017-04-26 13:12:22

4,ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR WAY AROUND ITS EASY TO NAVIGATE GOOD CLEAR MENUS NICE PRESENTATION. I HAVE ONLY STARTED USING FREEAGENT THIS WEEK AS I HAVE AN ACCOUNTANT BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY RUN IT ALONGSIDE. I AM GENERALLY VERY HAPPY WITH THE SOFTWARE NO GLICHES AT ALL. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN EXTRA COLUMN ON THE BANKING ACCOUNT PAGE THAT IS A RUNNING BALANCE. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PRINT PAGE BUTTON I AM AWARE OF THE REPORTS PAGE BUT SOMETIMES I LIKE TO PRINT OFF VARIOUS SECTIONS. OTHERWISE 9.50OUT OF 10 WHICH IS EXCELENT AS I AM NOW GOING TO SWITCH FROM MS MONEY TO FREEAGENT FOR MY PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS. SO I HAVE ALL MY FINANCES IN ONE PLACE BUT SEPERATED FROM MY BUSNESS ACCOUNT THANK YOU MIK TAYLOR,2017-04-26 09:02:04

5,"FreeAgent is a good system for tracking my company finances. Its easy to use, configurable, and has a great support team who are quick to respond.",2017-04-25 22:31:17
3,Easier than Excel. It would be nice if they took user comments on board. i am considering migrating to Xero which is integrated with WooCommerce.,2017-04-25 20:23:24
1,"The tool doesn´t have any search or order columns in any of its views ( bank statments, expenses, invoices ). That is a very basic capability. Also, The system doesn´t have any id for expenses. This means that when you update an expense this expense doesn´t have allocated an id, therefore when you download your data, it doesn´t have any order, and all your pictures of them have the same name. Finally, Freeagent doesn´t allow to dowload your own data. Only a CSV summary of each main page. If you work with different currencies, only shows a gross numbers, it doesn´t have the same order that in the web view, not all columns are included. You need to enter all by yourself in order to have a back for your accountant or you need to pay extra money to other services in order to back up your own data. I don´t recommend this tool, if you eventually want to use your data for HMRC, don´t rely on it. I am thinking moving to Xero, after a year with FreeAgent. I am tired of the lack of basic tools. I think it would be ok if it is free but if you have to pay 29 GBP monthly use Excel. ",2017-04-25 17:56:15

5,I love the simplicity of the whole product all backed up with an effecient email facility and a great range of informative help products.,2017-04-25 17:19:17
3,"Having trailed 5 other major online accounting services I can say FreeAgnet is very well thoughtout and easy to use. The ability to bill by a flat day rate and calculate hourly billing with rounding precision sets this product apart from its competitors, hence the draw for the freelancing and consulting community. Freeagent is however one of the most expensive products to own, especially factoring in the need to pay separately to use bulk upload features. I know for me, the price will ultimately drive me into the arms of a competitor when day rate billing is added. In summary, great product, too expensive. ",2017-04-25 16:38:18
5,It&#039;s so pretty. I love the illustrations in the comms. Easy to use. Makes my life far easier. ,2017-04-25 16:35:55
3,"Interesting that you only ask what made us happy. Here are a few things that I think would improve the software: 1. A way of dealing with CIS TAX. 2. The ability to sort invoices/projects/etc into ALPHABETICAL order. 3. More freedom to customise the layout of invoices, etc. (Without needing a coding degree!) E.g. Move information about the page, make certain fields more prominent. For example, I would like to see my projects more prominently positioned on the page, the ability to write notes in BOLD (instead of faded grey) ",2017-04-25 16:31:45

5,"Great for sole traders. My favourite tools are the time tracking tool and how easy it is to reconcile expenses and sales with my bank account. I do not know how it works with other similar apps but FreeAgent allows me to specify that it is a personal bank account and I do not have to explain personal and unrelated transactions. I am also happy that I can fill related self-assessment information before hand. Makes everything easy for my accountant and helped reduce her work (and her fees, as a result).",2017-04-25 14:31:43

I have also used Xero for a different business. I love the reconciliation, the dashboard and the dividend forecast and vouchers. The tax time line is very nice and they really thing about real people running a business instead of accountants. Minor things that can be improved but by far the best out there.

5,I&#039;ve used a few competitor book keeping products before in the past and I find FreeAgent to be the most user-friendly system out there. It&#039;s easy to do day to day tasks such as adding timesheets and expenses. Generating a tax return and VAT returns were simple processes too. I&#039;d recommend FreeAgent to anyone working as a freelancer or contractor!,2017-04-25 13:08:46
5,"Excellent support, breadth of functionality and features!",2017-04-25 12:56:52
4,Has been phenomenal for helping me set up my business...but it&#039;s not great now we&#039;re reaching 15-20 employees. Would highly recommend for freelancers or micro businesses.,2016-11-30 16:54:25
5,First of all starting a new company I was worried about keeping all the accounts upto date and dealing with tax. FreeAgent has made things so simple. I actually enjoy the last 20 minutes of my day inputting the data and seeing exactly where I&#039;m at. Anyone thinking about joining this code gets you 10% off 45sizv3u worked for me so saves you bit whilst your getting started. Good Luck ,2016-08-30 08:04:36
5,"Great value, the recurring invoices themselves more than pay for the monthly cost. Customer service is also great with fast responses and clear instructions to solve problems.",2016-05-03 10:36:46
5,I really like the fact that is linked to HMRC and how easy it is to take a picture of the receipt and download it to justify each expense. Free Agent is easy to use and just love it.,2016-04-28 22:56:28
5,Straightforward on-line accounts package with excellent reconciliation facilities and banking uploads without using a third party. Good telephone support and the ability to download ALL data as an excel spreadsheet a big plus,2016-04-26 17:40:09
5,"Love Freeagent. All my business finances in one place - easy invoicing and follow up, at-a-glance overview of income and outgoings, expenses easily tracked and receipts uploaded and lots more. No longer have to search in a paper file to check whether I&#039;ve sent an invoice or not and check whether laid or not. All this and great response from support team when I have a query I haven&#039;t been able to work out. Couldn&#039;t possibly do without Freeagent! ",2016-04-26 15:16:33
5,This is an excellent product,2016-04-26 13:00:21
5,Great product,2016-04-21 11:16:20
5,Excellent support!,2016-04-06 11:14:47
5,"As a seasoned Sage user it took me a little while to appreciate the differences in FreeAgent BUT I would never ever go back to Sage now. FreeAgent is smart, it learns and each month I have to do less and less. Just incredible. Clients love it too. Filing my tax return on 31st Jan took just moments (compare that to a friend who logged on to HMRC and spent the whole morning trying to submit hers.) I didn&#039;t expect to be so impressed - things so often disappoint but FreeAgent has been everything I hoped it might be, and more. Highly recommended.",2014-02-26 12:48:48
5,I have found the support provided by FreeAgent both during the 30 day trial as well as our set up has been excellent. All responses have been quick and have provided helpful and concise advice. I can&#039;t fault the support received so far so thank you! ,2014-02-25 13:51:46
5,"Really good, makes running the finances so much easier, I used customer support to ask questions for my partners account and that was excellent",2014-02-23 16:50:58
5,So far so good!,2014-02-23 11:04:32
5,Very easy to use and links exactly with what we need. Altogether. ,2014-02-22 11:14:19
5,So far so good - easy to use!,2014-02-22 07:31:30
4,Overall I think it is a good platform which has very good customer service. Very good for issuing invoices and tracking payments directly through my banking account. I think the pathway from contact to project to invoice could be a little clearer but otherwise it seems that it is constantly evolving which is good. At the moment it is £16.20 a month for me which I think is a little bit steep for the self-employed but at the moment it is something I&#039;m willing to pay to keep track of my clients payments and give me a tax estimate at a glance.,2014-02-21 15:17:16
5,"I wish I had know about you long before I did! You have made my Book Keeping so easy and linking it in to my HMRC Tax Return is bliss. Bye bye cluncky spreadsheets, manual calculations and figuring out which category an expense goes into. Thank you again for such an easy to use online system. Claire",2014-02-20 12:25:39
5,"I still haven&#039;t explored all the features of Free Agent because I am new to small business. However, most things I really like. Two things I would like: 1. A good iPhone app - Mainly to enter expenses on the go, but also to get an overview of things. 2. I find the fact that I have to create a task first for time tracking a bit clunky as I sometimes just want to hit &quot;Go&quot; and assign to a task later. Unless I am missing something. All in all though, I really like it.",2014-02-20 12:20:37
5,"Love it, it does everything I want it to do apart from let me raise Purchase Orders. ",2014-02-20 11:52:51
5,"I run a one person service business and decided to reduce my accountant&#039;s fees and gain more control by automating and doing more myself. I chose FreeAgent because its also being used by a start up I am involved with. Thus far I have been very impressed. It seems to do everything I need in a simple and understandable way. However, the real gem, is ion the support team. I inevitably have had a few queries on how to do things and their response has been absolutely brilliant. Very fast and helpful. It makes a real change t deal with a Company that seems to understand customer service and support. Highly recommended :-) ",2014-02-20 10:58:33
5,"I&#039;ve recently migrated from Fresh Books (FB) - which was a very good service but was not aimed at providing accountancy functionality, which is where I was spending far too much time (book keeping, producing annual returns, etc). So, from that perspective, Free Agent (FA) looks like it&#039;s going to save me a heap of time - the importing &amp; reconciling bank statements/transactions has already saved me lots of time. Where FA could be improved (in comparison with FB) is as follows: 1) setting up universal Tasks. It&#039;s annoying having to assign the identical task to each project. We offer similar services (SEO, hosting, domain names, etc) to all our clients, yet we seem to have to re-enter the same tasks for each new project. FB offered these as a global dropdown that could be attached to each project, but with the option of overriding the price on a per usage basis) 2) Contacts - yes, you can add &gt;1 contact to an organisation, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be a global view of an organisation, with all its contacts, projects, etc. For example, in FB it was easy adding &gt; 1 contact to an invoice. Not sure this is possible with FA? 3) Time billing. In FB I was able to setup &quot;self&quot; project - projects that I did for my company - like attending a sales meeting, etc. I could then add non-billable time to this project, &amp; have the opportunity to later transfer this as billable time to a resulting project with a new/existing client. There doesn&#039;t seem to be an intuitive way to do this in FB. This means at the moment I can only see billable time on timesheets - I&#039;d like an easy overview of all staff time on billable &amp; non-billable work - is this possible in FA? Overall, I&#039;ve been impressed with FA &amp; have not regretted the migration from FB. Indeed, the one time I called support they got back promptly and were able to talk me through how to properly reconcile my bank statements to make sure balances were in sync. Having UK support staff was really great, especially having support available during my office hours. ",2014-02-20 10:40:51
5,"A great service really easy to use and setup, the bank feeds are great. Client login to view invoices and make payment online may be good and possible the ability to used your own domain by creating a cname. ",2014-02-20 10:35:30
4,"FreeAgent is a really well thought out system which is very easy to understand for non accounting people like me. The automatic bank feed from Barclays is fantastic but there are a lot of problems with the Lloyds one through Yodlee. The system of Invoice templates is a bit basic and doesn&#039;t easily allow creation of your own or to save multiple templates. Purchase orders for stock is a surprising omission too. Bugs on a couple of the bank feeds have been hanging around a long time unfixed which is disappointing. Undoubtedly the best part of FreeAgent is the support staff who are nothing short of excellent. Short, if not instant response times even at weekends mean you are never waiting long for advice and all the team are experienced accountants. This is the best support team I have ever come across anywhere, WELL DONE! :-)",2014-02-20 10:32:10
5,"So simple to use. Makes managing my business a pleasure instead of a chore. Always looking for excuses to log in. At all times I have a good handle on my financial position. Support is excellent, with real personable individuals who go above and beyond. The people at FreeAgent are rockstars!",2014-02-20 10:24:58
5,"The only aspects of FA that I feel could be improved as the time tracking reporting. It would be good to see better summaries of which clients / projects we&#039;ve worked on over the last day / week / month / year etc... Possibly add a native OSx app for time tracking. I use Slips but if my machine crashes I loose the time I had tracked. You could do something clever with local storage and auto-saving... Other than that it&#039;s ACE! Thanks, Rich",2014-02-20 10:24:35
5,Moved to FreeAgent after using quickbooks desktop for several years and I am really impressed with how automated a lot of the services are. ,2014-02-20 10:23:38
5,"Free Agent is excellent, very easy to use. The software is intelligent - helping you to make allocations. Only thing which I found confusing was having to call all staff who submit expenses &#039;Users&#039;. Tim Fuller",2014-02-20 10:22:19
5,"Running your own business especially one you&#039;ve grown from the ground up demands you to be an fluent not only in your specialism but also in supporting functions such as financial administration. Money is often very tight as is time and the luxury of employing a good quality book keeper or finance director is not always practical and so good finance software is a must. Over the years we tried a good number of money apps but they&#039;ve all suffered from failings from being difficult to use and understands, lacking in flexibility, or geared to get you buying into the next level at often silly prices. FreeAgent is not one of those. It&#039;s marvellously simply to use with lots of nice little features that help tie all the little transactions together that would normally take a number of ledger entries. It&#039;s tolerant of mistakes and best of all has brilliant support when you need it. It&#039;s actually made handling finance enjoyable - something I thought I would never hear myself saying. We&#039;ve only been using FreeAgent for a few short weeks but its already changed the way we work for the better, Our business looks more professional and our admin workload has dropped away. FreeAgent is ace. ",2014-02-20 10:17:21
4,"In general, very good. Would be 5-stars if you could group contacts into one company and export invoice list better.",2014-02-20 10:12:38
3,"Twelve months ago I would have said very good, but the standard of telephone support has really deteriorated. I have felt mislead and poorly treated. The software is excellent but I no longer trust those working on it.",2014-02-20 10:06:49
5,"I couldn&#039;t run my business without FreeAgent. The service means I can do my book keeping, estimates, invoices, time tracking and keep an eye on my bank accounts all from one place. I&#039;ve been using FreeAgent for five years now, and I&#039;ve never had any complaints. If I&#039;ve ever had a problem, their support has been lightning fast to respond. Even with accounting difficulties! Recently I got an accountant and she can log in to my FreeAgent with her own account and easily calculate my taxes and everything else for me. I&#039;m not usually someone who bothers writing reviews, but FreeAgent is so great that I have to shout about it!",2014-02-20 10:03:19
5,"Very impressed with FreeAgent. As an IT contractor, it matches my accounting needs perfectly.",2014-02-20 10:01:48
5,"I absolutely love Freeagent. The software is amazing and the support 2nd to none. I would like to see an option of making Purchase orders, that can then link through to an invoice. Keep up the top work. ",2014-02-14 11:30:15
5,"Very helpful and easy to use. Also very easy to track due invoices, incomes, etc. Automatic integration with my bank so I don&#039;t have to keep manually uploading my bank statements.",2014-02-14 09:38:40
4,Freeagent has made managing accounts not only efficient but actually enjoyable. ,2014-02-14 09:31:49
5,The product is great. ,2014-02-14 06:46:43
4,"It takes a bit of effort to learn how to keep your account sup to date, but ones you understand the system it is straight forward. Being able to upload transactions direct from my bank is a real benefit (it&#039;s a shame you I can&#039;t upload my commercial credit card statement in the same way) and saves considerable time. However, to monitor cash in hand accurately you need to download the information regularly. Other good features are the automatic calculation of VAT, the ability to give my accountant access to my information and the ability to automatically enter regular expenses. ",2014-02-13 18:10:29
5,"I was really anxious when I set up my limited company about the accounts. But FreeAgent has made it so easy! I also use the mobileApp daily for my time sheets, mileage and expenses which makes it simple to keep everything up to date. ",2014-02-13 17:46:13
4,I have used three systems and have found Free agent to be the best and most relevant for my requirements. Good help desk facility.,2014-02-13 15:39:37
5,"I&#039;ve used Freeagent as a sole trader, a limited company and currently for a 6-partner limited liability partnership. It just makes life so much easier; multi-currency invoicing is a doddle, bank transactions and paypal transactions are automatically pulled into your accounts for reconciliation and explanation, expenses and billing are all well thought-out and easy to use, and I don&#039;t have to spend hours every week doing bookkeeping. For me, the most important thing about Freeagent is that it means that our management team always have access to the latest P/L and Balance sheeet. There are no surprises, no paperwork and we can concentrate on our business. ",2014-02-13 12:42:07
5,Great site with good support. Isnt the cheapest product about but well worth the extra cost,2014-02-13 12:20:05
5,I have an accountant but use the services of Freeagent to keep my accounts in order and to allow both myself and my accountant quick access to my business figures. Support is by far the best I have come across thus far... and I am an IT Director!!,2014-02-13 11:12:56
5,I manage accounts for 3 separate companies. Since starting using FreeAgent the workload for this has dramatically reduced. The simplicity and usability of the software is exceptional and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it. One feature request I have is that I would like to be able to upload Purchase Orders and generate Purchase orders in the system. there are ways I can work around it to some degree but having first class support would be very helpful,2014-02-13 10:58:22
