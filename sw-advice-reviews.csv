On the few occasions that I've needed assistance, I've had an almost immediate response with helpful information. Highly recommended.It felt a little expensive at first as a solo trader, but I think it proved its worth in ease of use so quickly this isn't really a con. Plus they have a great affiliate scheme so you can bring the overall cost down by recommending others. "
new-stars-rank__100,Highly recommended,"I got access to this software FREE of charge through banking with RBS. Having previously used Xero for our book-keeping, I found it had the same great functionality  but a much slicker design. It's simplicity and ease of use is the best thing going for it. Had some issues at the beginning with connecting our bank feeds but this was sorted out quickly by the team at FreeAgent - can't think of any real faults with the software. "

new-stars-rank__100,The only accounting software I would use,Great customer support- all from trained accountants in the UK that are able to walk you through any problems you might encounter when doing you tax and vat returnsNone- inpeciable and consistent service at all times. 
new-stars-rank__100,So much easier ,The bank reconciling makes marking off transactions and paid invoices so easy.

More template options would be good and the ability to put terms and conditions into the back of a invoice. 
new-stars-rank__100,Essential tool for managing finance,* Auto integration with banking API feeds  * Intelligent learning for your regular banking transactions  * Templates for sending invoices etc  * VAT & SA form integration with HMRC  * Slightly clunky UI for viewing recent expenses   * Inability to remove user's who have left the business  
new-stars-rank__100,Fantastically simple accounting software for small businesses,Incredibly easy to learn how to use even if you've never managed a business before.  Perfect for freelancers as well as small-businesses. Nice design both for the website as well as the PDFs created.Large businesses and more experienced accountants are likely to find the functionality a bit limiting.  
new-stars-rank__100,Quite possibly saved my business,"Where to start. I LOVE Freeagent! It's so easy to use, it gives great reports, it automatically pulls in bank statements! Brilliant!The only thing I would like to see is a little more clarity regarding the different categories of spending and VAT eligibility."
new-stars-rank__100,Very easy and great help function,I love how it links to my bank account and easily allows me to enter bills and mark them paid.  Some trickier transaction types were not obvious but the help screen is comprehensive.I haven't found an account reconciliation feature. I am used to that with QuickBooks and would like to have it here. It's possible there is a reconciliation feature and I haven't spotted it yet.

new-stars-rank__100,Took the worst part of owning a business and made it almost fun,The end to end connectivity. Booking time spent with a client turns into an invoice turns into a payment at the bank - and all this is tracked. What used to take hours in excel is all at a glance in FreeAgent. I wish that there was a way to use their time tracking module as a separate product. I no longer run a business but would love to use their time tracker with my team at the larger org I now work for. 
new-stars-rank__100,The perfect accounting software for freelancers,"It's an incredibly easy to use all-in-one accounting solution that's built for freelancers, all the way up to large businesses. Creating and managing invoices is very easy and you can even sync it up to your bank account. Whilst many of the more advanced accounting features go unused by myself I can clearly see the value in them for others.It's not the cheapest solution if you're just creating a few invoices each month but for any typical independent professional it's a great solution. I can't think of any real cons to this product."
new-stars-rank__100,Easily halved my time spent on bookkeeping and accounting,"I've worked with accounting software before so it didn't need much time to set up. I also like how everything is linked  contacts to invoices to banking feed... lots of the features are automised so you don't have to do everything twice and the system learns and adapts to your set up, e.g. it starts guessing the categories for expenses and other items in your banking feed.It doesn't come cheap which for a freelancer is perhaps the biggest hurdle. But it is good value for money."
new-stars-rank__100,Easy to use accounting software and a great mobile app,"FreeAgent is great in January when I can file my tax return directly to HMRC. The form is also filled with data I've entered throughout the year so self assessment time is pretty hassle free, which s unusual for a freelancer. I've just started using the mobile app and find that this is really is good too. I can take care of all the day-to-day stuff, like explaining bank transactions and entering mileage, when I'm out and about on business to stop it mounting up.The mobile app is really great, but doesn't yet have the same in-depth functionality as the desktop app."
new-stars-rank__100,Brilliant tool that I rely on daily,"It just works. The software looks good on desktop and connects to the mobile app well. From invoicing, to time tracking, to payroll, tax returns ... so much functionality and pretty much error free. Unlike other financial software, you don't need to pay more for features like payroll and multi-currency. Win.It would be useful to have a few more multi-currency features (e.g. multi-currency bills and expenses)."
new-stars-rank__100,FreeAgent - Great and Gets Better,"FreeAgent is a fantastic product.  I have only needed to use support a couple of times and they were more unusual questions.    As a freelancer, keeping an eye on income and expenditure, billing and chasing invoices and recording expenses with my phone is really important.  Add to that the easy submission of my tax return and it really is a great piece of software.I am a little disappointed that I could not receive any of the discounts offered to new customers.  (e.g. 6 months half price)."
new-stars-rank__100,Fantastic - makes my business life so much easier,"Love the user interface, which is easily customisable and visually it is really appealing. Makes accounting fun!  Easy to use, once you know how to access some of the features.  I have a straightforward business in private medical practice and this software takes care of my invoicing, accounting and expenses all in one, with automatic updating of all the relevant information at your fingertips.  Both my secretary and I can access the software from anywhere, so it makes for easy team-work.  One of the best features for me is the projects section, where I can keep track of the numerous expert reports that I have on my books at any one time.Sometimes working out how to find something, or to alter a document isn't intuitive, and I have had to refer to the website for help, which has always been useful (so far).  (NB I think the user who didn't like being referred to My Business Works is being unnecessarily unfair to this software because they had to go through a Barclays intermediary - Barclays are known for their poor service, but this is not FreeAgent...)"

new-stars-rank__100,An outstanding find with exemplary customer service,"The ease of use combined of the platform which is exceptionally intuitive, combined with the brilliant customer service.FreeAgent appears somewhat UK-centric, although the support is still exceptional. The banking does connect to banks in Canada and I have been able to manage harmonized sales tax in Ontario. It may have some current limitations to make it a credible better substitute for Sage, in respect of the tax nuances across different Canadian Provinces."

Everything I need, from invoicing and clients database, to expense filing and completing my self-assessment is there, easy to use and access.

new-stars-rank__100,Very convenient and easy to use/implement,"Ease to use, easy to input data and access to overview info. quote feature is SO convenient.

You gotta go around several times in order to have the chance to modify data that was missplaced."
new-stars-rank__100,Excellent software for my business,"I run a limited liability partnership and FreeAgent gives me the ability to control the accounts without having to involve accountants.

The best accounting software I've yet discovered for a freelancer business.  It has all of our needs covered.I had some initial issues but that was mainly because I didn't know what I was doing.  A bit of browsing round the help pages soon sorted that out."
new-stars-rank__100,Love it,"Exceptionally easy to use and easy to learn. I keep the tab open every day. It's easy to ""undo"" if you make a mistake in an invoice. There's basically nothing that can't be undone by reverting to draft. The recurring invoices tool is really helpful. I don't use the feature where it'll email invoices/reminders. I prefer to do that myself and it's really easy nothing to really keep track of since I invoice all clients on the same day each month. They make it easy to label bank transactions so as long as I remember to do that once a month or so, all my accounting reports are always current. I don't have to spend too much time on accounting and I don't really have any complaints. The customer service is always fantastic.I wish the time tracking feature were just a little slicker. I use Toggl for time tracking, and then I import hours for each client each month. Not a big deal, but one of those little things that would put it over the top."
new-stars-rank__100,Does it all,"It's so easy to use. I haven't had any training on it (no need, it's pretty intuitive, and you can find answers easily on the Internet).

new-stars-rank__100,"Good product, good UI, good customer support, a bit pricey but worth it for my business.","FreeAgent is a fully-featured accounting and invoicing web app that comes with a great little mobile app too.     It has a really clear and easy-to-use interface, making it easy to navigate and produce invoices, check your accounts for selected periods, track your time, manage projects... the list goes on. But for all the functionality, it never feels cluttered.    I've experienced great support whenever I've asked for it and it hasn't ever produced any unexpected errors or bugs. It just works.I wanted to recommend this product to my wife for her business but it's just a little bit too expensive for a startup small sole trader company like hers. A reduced cost account type for single users would be great."
new-stars-rank__100,Takes the pain out of keeping accounts,"Pros: ability to photograph receipts and store them within expenses  All the main categories of expenses are there  Links to your business bank accountCon: One major drawback is that you can't print out a consolidated tax return before or after filing. For sole traders a tax return is often the only way to prove income when applying for loans, etc, and HMRC doesn't offer this service either."
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,Keeps me organised.,FreeAgent is great for tracking projects from quote to invoice to payment. It makes the daunting task of tax a breeze too.There are always a few user specific scenarios that aren't catered for (usually there is a work around). Can't think of any for me though.
new-stars-rank__100,Keeps me informed and saves time and money,It allows me to keep on top of the financial position of my company allowing me to make decisions with up to date knowledge. Compared to my peers who don't use the software I am saving time and money doing my accounting.The mobile app is not as feature rich and some of the functionality that it does have does not share the same options as the web version e.g. split transactions
new-stars-rank__100,Brilliant,"I love free agent. It makes invoicing, book keeping and automating reminders very easy. It's also very easy to modify your invoice designs. Customer support has always been good on the few occasions I've needed them.I'd like to be able to do reports on a monthly basis rather than the preset options. Little bit more expensive than it's rivals."

It just works.I wanted to recommend this product to my wife for her business but it's just a little bit too expensive for a startup small sole trader company like hers. A reduced cost account type for single users would be great."
new-stars-rank__100,Takes the pain out of keeping accounts,"Pros: ability to photograph receipts and store them within expenses  All the main categories of expenses are there  Links to your business bank accountCon: One major drawback is that you can't print out a consolidated tax return before or after filing. For sole traders a tax return is often the only way to prove income when applying for loans, etc, and HMRC doesn't offer this service either."

new-stars-rank__100,Keeps me organised.,FreeAgent is great for tracking projects from quote to invoice to payment. It makes the daunting task of tax a breeze too.There are always a few user specific scenarios that aren't catered for (usually there is a work around). Can't think of any for me though.
new-stars-rank__100,Keeps me informed and saves time and money,It allows me to keep on top of the financial position of my company allowing me to make decisions with up to date knowledge. Compared to my peers who don't use the software I am saving time and money doing my accounting.The mobile app is not as feature rich and some of the functionality that it does have does not share the same options as the web version e.g. split transactions
new-stars-rank__100,Brilliant,"I love free agent. It makes invoicing, book keeping and automating reminders very easy. It's also very easy to modify your invoice designs. Customer support has always been good on the few occasions I've needed them.I'd like to be able to do reports on a monthly basis rather than the preset options. Little bit more expensive than it's rivals."
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,"Great accunting software, really easy to use!","Fantastic software for your company.  Easy to use and complete. You can manage your customers, raise invoices and do your payroll.The software is improving over the years, but you might have some issues when it comes to make payments and raise invoices in other currencies."
new-stars-rank__90,Great accounting software for freelancers and small teams,"Perfect for freelancers and small teams, FreeAgent includes all the aspects needed to control accounts, create / send invoices and keep an eye on projects. Highly recommended for any solo practitioners.If you plan to grow and scale your team, it can be a bit limiting, however it is still a great tool for smaller teams and individuals."
new-stars-rank__100,I'd be lost without it!,"I've been using FreeAgent for approximately 5 years, I think, and I would be lost without it. The app is really user-friendly, and I love how easy it is to submit my accounts to HMRC at the end of the year. On the few occasions that I've needed assistance, I've had an almost immediate response with helpful information. Highly recommended.It felt a little expensive at first as a solo trader, but I think it proved its worth in ease of use so quickly this isn't really a con. Plus they have a great affiliate scheme so you can bring the overall cost down by recommending others. "
new-stars-rank__100,Highly recommended,"I got access to this software FREE of charge through banking with RBS. Having previously used Xero for our book-keeping, I found it had the same great functionality  but a much slicker design. It's simplicity and ease of use is the best thing going for it. Had some issues at the beginning with connecting our bank feeds but this was sorted out quickly by the team at FreeAgent - can't think of any real faults with the software. "
new-stars-rank__100,Keeping Track Of My Finances,It is really easy to use and the data is displayed in a useful formatThe one downside is that it doesn't pull in the USD transactions from Paypal and this has to be done manually. 
new-stars-rank__100,We love this product!,"Makes accounting for our small but complex company simple and easy to understand.  It's clear, with lots of support, and has taken over from the spreadsheets/Sage/panic that used to be our system.  No cons - it really does solve all our accounting and administration issues"
new-stars-rank__100,My Accounting friend,"I use freeagent everyday for my business and it's like the best so far. Helps to generate invoices and estimates for client, it gives an overview of your account in the first page which you can easily see at first glance. I recommend freeagent anyday anytime.Freeagent generates number for each of the invoice or estimates which can be confusing sometimes especially if you have to delete that invoice or estimates but nevertheless it's a stress free software, it does all the work. "
new-stars-rank__100,Easily Navigated Platform,"Primarily, the best part about this product is Ease of use. Very straight forward and simplistic to learn. This product has 2 drawbacks: Doesn't text customers  Email campaign tracking features are very limited"
new-stars-rank__100,"If you're running a small business, you need this!","It's amazing accounting software and it's cheap as well. It does all for you, you don't have to have some great knowledge for it to use. I love it.I don't have anything negative to say about it."
new-stars-rank__100,Wilford,"It has a customizable   visual interface that makes working with this program great.  The projects section also has some great reporting functions. The recurring billing is a little bit difficult to get to grips with but once you understand it, there are no issues. "
new-stars-rank__100,The only accounting software I would use,Great customer support- all from trained accountants in the UK that are able to walk you through any problems you might encounter when doing you tax and vat returnsNone- inpeciable and consistent service at all times. 
new-stars-rank__100,So much easier ,The bank reconciling makes marking off transactions and paid invoices so easy. The ability to resend email reminders and show whether an email has been received by a customer is great. More template options would be good and the ability to put terms and conditions into the back of a invoice. 
new-stars-rank__100,Essential tool for managing finance,* Auto integration with banking API feeds  * Intelligent learning for your regular banking transactions  * Templates for sending invoices etc  * VAT & SA form integration with HMRC  * Slightly clunky UI for viewing recent expenses   * Inability to remove user's who have left the business  
new-stars-rank__100,Fantastically simple accounting software for small businesses,Incredibly easy to learn how to use even if you've never managed a business before.  Perfect for freelancers as well as small-businesses. Nice design both for the website as well as the PDFs created.Large businesses and more experienced accountants are likely to find the functionality a bit limiting.  
new-stars-rank__100,Quite possibly saved my business,"Where to start. I LOVE Freeagent! It's so easy to use, it gives great reports, it automatically pulls in bank statements! Brilliant!The only thing I would like to see is a little more clarity regarding the different categories of spending and VAT eligibility."
new-stars-rank__100,Very easy and great help function,I love how it links to my bank account and easily allows me to enter bills and mark them paid.  Some trickier transaction types were not obvious but the help screen is comprehensive.I haven't found an account reconciliation feature. I am used to that with QuickBooks and would like to have it here. It's possible there is a reconciliation feature and I haven't spotted it yet.
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,Took the worst part of owning a business and made it almost fun,The end to end connectivity. Booking time spent with a client turns into an invoice turns into a payment at the bank - and all this is tracked. What used to take hours in excel is all at a glance in FreeAgent. I wish that there was a way to use their time tracking module as a separate product. I no longer run a business but would love to use their time tracker with my team at the larger org I now work for. 
new-stars-rank__100,The perfect accounting software for freelancers,"It's an incredibly easy to use all-in-one accounting solution that's built for freelancers, all the way up to large businesses. Creating and managing invoices is very easy and you can even sync it up to your bank account. Whilst many of the more advanced accounting features go unused by myself I can clearly see the value in them for others.It's not the cheapest solution if you're just creating a few invoices each month but for any typical independent professional it's a great solution. I can't think of any real cons to this product."
new-stars-rank__100,Easily halved my time spent on bookkeeping and accounting,"I've worked with accounting software before so it didn't need much time to set up. I also like how everything is linked  contacts to invoices to banking feed... lots of the features are automised so you don't have to do everything twice and the system learns and adapts to your set up, e.g. it starts guessing the categories for expenses and other items in your banking feed.It doesn't come cheap which for a freelancer is perhaps the biggest hurdle. But it is good value for money."
new-stars-rank__100,Easy to use accounting software and a great mobile app,"FreeAgent is great in January when I can file my tax return directly to HMRC. The form is also filled with data I've entered throughout the year so self assessment time is pretty hassle free, which s unusual for a freelancer. I've just started using the mobile app and find that this is really is good too. I can take care of all the day-to-day stuff, like explaining bank transactions and entering mileage, when I'm out and about on business to stop it mounting up.The mobile app is really great, but doesn't yet have the same in-depth functionality as the desktop app."
new-stars-rank__100,Brilliant tool that I rely on daily,"It just works. The software looks good on desktop and connects to the mobile app well. From invoicing, to time tracking, to payroll, tax returns ... so much functionality and pretty much error free. Unlike other financial software, you don't need to pay more for features like payroll and multi-currency. Win.It would be useful to have a few more multi-currency features (e.g. multi-currency bills and expenses)."
new-stars-rank__100,FreeAgent - Great and Gets Better,"FreeAgent is a fantastic product.  I have only needed to use support a couple of times and they were more unusual questions.    As a freelancer, keeping an eye on income and expenditure, billing and chasing invoices and recording expenses with my phone is really important.  Add to that the easy submission of my tax return and it really is a great piece of software.I am a little disappointed that I could not receive any of the discounts offered to new customers.  (e.g. 6 months half price)."
new-stars-rank__100,Fantastic - makes my business life so much easier,"Love the user interface, which is easily customisable and visually it is really appealing. Makes accounting fun!  Easy to use, once you know how to access some of the features.  I have a straightforward business in private medical practice and this software takes care of my invoicing, accounting and expenses all in one, with automatic updating of all the relevant information at your fingertips.  Both my secretary and I can access the software from anywhere, so it makes for easy team-work.  One of the best features for me is the projects section, where I can keep track of the numerous expert reports that I have on my books at any one time.Sometimes working out how to find something, or to alter a document isn't intuitive, and I have had to refer to the website for help, which has always been useful (so far).  (NB I think the user who didn't like being referred to My Business Works is being unnecessarily unfair to this software because they had to go through a Barclays intermediary - Barclays are known for their poor service, but this is not FreeAgent...)"
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,An outstanding find with exemplary customer service,"The ease of use combined of the platform which is exceptionally intuitive, combined with the brilliant customer service.FreeAgent appears somewhat UK-centric, although the support is still exceptional. The banking does connect to banks in Canada and I have been able to manage harmonized sales tax in Ontario. It may have some current limitations to make it a credible better substitute for Sage, in respect of the tax nuances across different Canadian Provinces."
new-stars-rank__100,Business usage,"I like the simplicity, direct tax sending features  and time tracking. App solution for mobile is also very goodI would like to have my projecta overview on mobile. I dont get why should I write at least one hundred characters here...."
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,Its good,"Easy to setup and use - the mobile app is pretty good making it easy to add expenses.  Bank feed is handy. I use the API to import expenses.Expensive compared to competitors like Xero, bank feed is slow.  Perhaps you can add integrations for credit cards too to automatically pull in expenses."
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,Essential for sole trader's accounting,"One of the things that scared me about going freelance, was the accounting and book-keeping part this entails. After researching similar web-based solutions, I decided upon subscribing to Freeagent. I wouldn't be able to run my business without it. Everything I need, from invoicing and clients database, to expense filing and completing my self-assessment is there, easy to use and access. When I needed some help or clarifications about something, the staff were prompt and eager to help me and made sure my issues were resolved in any case. Highly recommended software & service!I find that the mobile app has limited functionality compared to the desktop site. I would like the same level of editability when it comes to the handling of bank transactions, as I have via my internet browser."
new-stars-rank__100,High quality accounting with unparalleled ease.,
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,,
new-stars-rank__100,Brilliant- wouldnt use anything else to run my business,Incredibly customer support from trained accountants who are always able to give me advise as and when i need it.Only thing I would change is being able to re-enrol for VAT instead of having to open a new account as it took some time to transfer my data over into a new account.
new-stars-rank__100,Very convenient and easy to use/implement,"Ease to use, easy to input data and access to overview info. quote feature is SO convenient. Gives you the professional looks we wanted to transmit to our customers. Convenient database to keep track on projectsReports adjustments and correcting info is a bit complicated. You gotta go around several times in order to have the chance to modify data that was missplaced."
new-stars-rank__100,Excellent software for my business,"I run a limited liability partnership and FreeAgent gives me the ability to control the accounts without having to involve accountants.  Everything is so easy from generating the accounts for Companies House, managing my travel expenses, time tracking and billing, and sorting out VAT and self assessment returns.  The best accounting software I've yet discovered for a freelancer business.  It has all of our needs covered.I had some initial issues but that was mainly because I didn't know what I was doing.  A bit of browsing round the help pages soon sorted that out."
new-stars-rank__100,Love it,"Exceptionally easy to use and easy to learn. I keep the tab open every day. It's easy to ""undo"" if you make a mistake in an invoice. There's basically nothing that can't be undone by reverting to draft. The recurring invoices tool is really helpful. I don't use the feature where it'll email invoices/reminders. I prefer to do that myself and it's really easy nothing to really keep track of since I invoice all clients on the same day each month. They make it easy to label bank transactions so as long as I remember to do that once a month or so, all my accounting reports are always current. I don't have to spend too much time on accounting and I don't really have any complaints. The customer service is always fantastic.I wish the time tracking feature were just a little slicker. I use Toggl for time tracking, and then I import hours for each client each month. Not a big deal, but one of those little things that would put it over the top."
new-stars-rank__100,Does it all,"It's so easy to use. I haven't had any training on it (no need, it's pretty intuitive, and you can find answers easily on the Internet). It's always there on my desktop or phone. I used to use Excel spreadsheet which was free, but a bit of a 'mare, but now I have peace of mind knowing I'm compliant.    I haven't used it for my self-assessment yet, but will soon find out how easy that is too. Fingers crossed.The importing tranasctions don't always work. I'm not VAT registered and so have to manually change this every time. A way to schedule recurring future invoices in advance would be good too."
